<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659020">Bovianum is the Samnite capital. Reports indicate that Rutilus is being held here. We face a long war before we can hope to free the Consul.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659520">Commander! The Britons force their way through on our flank!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659820">Excellent! With matters settled at home, attention can turn to the Samnites once again. The Senate have decreed that they must not be allowed to threaten Rome again. Consul Rutilus must be recovered! Bovianum must fall!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660023">Our blades our turned! We must retreat!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660123">Fortunate in your ties to both Hellenic and Eastern cultures, you nonetheless face adversity: Cappadocia, now independent from Seleucid rule, is eager to establish itself in Asia. Cultural differences with the Galatians may lead to hostility, but they are fearsome warriors and might prove valuable – if unconventional – allies. Maintain close relations with Bithynia and Trapezos, and establish ties with the venerable Greek states: this way, you will be better protected against the machinations of the Seleucids and can focus on seizing control of the Pontic sea from barbarian hands. Power and riches will be yours: Pontus will reign supreme!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660323">You can see that Capua's city limits grow to accomodate the new construction site. Now instruct the labourers to begin the workshop itself.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661923">Your greatness impresses me! Another victory! Good!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662123">All rebellion against Egypt and mighty Pharaoh must be righteous punished! Well done for this chastisement!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662723">An agreement worthy of Mercury himself!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663323">Splendid! Trade with the Greeks will bring income, new types of material resources, and will encourage them to favour our cause over that of our enemies.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659321">Carthage is ours! These people shall defy Rome no more!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659421">My Lord, the Seleucid forces approach us! Our elephants will not stand being close to those of the enemy! Please, avoid them at all costs!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660622">Take the time to manage your person, Silanus, and those who serve under you. The plebs will rally behind leaders of high standing. Such a figure would be useful now: I'm afraid I bring news that a crisis has arisen in Rome.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660922">This is good! The enemy's siege gear is captured for Rome.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662022">Worthy servant of Egypt! Your army has reached a higher level of development.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662122">You are wise to seek knowledge in the encyclopaedia! Well done!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662922">A defensive alliance is agreed between two factions and pledges allegiance that guarantees support should either faction be attacked. While not as far-reaching as a full military alliance, it should not be taken lightly. Should either faction come under threat, the other is obligated to mobilise their forces to assist. Refusing to support an ally breaks the agreement, significantly damages diplomatic relations between the two factions, and generally leads to global mistrust of the faction involved.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663222">The more ambitious a character is, the more useful they are likely to be to your faction. However, it is a double-edged sword: high [[url:/manual/single-player/0037_enc_page_campaign_play_faction_politics]]ambition[[/url]] can lead to a bid for power through [[url:/manual/single-player/0037_enc_page_campaign_play_faction_politics#enc_text_politics_civil_war]]civil war[[/url]], so it is important to keep an eye on such characters, they are not necessarily to be trusted.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1387459530">Outflanking forces can be turned into fixing forces. If you commit a large outflanking force and do not attack from the front, the enemy will be forced to turn and face you, presenting his flanks to what was your centre.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658422">If your party becomes too powerful, mistrust and paranoia ultimately lead to a challenge for control of your faction. At this point, [[url:/manual/single-player/0037_enc_page_campaign_play_faction_politics#enc_text_politics_civil_war]]civil war[[/url]] ensues; the remaining parties unite and lead rebel forces to capture the capital and overthrow your regime. Similarly, should you be deemed too weak, you may be exiled as an enemy of the state. </string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663021">By moving an army into a settlement, it becomes part of the garrison. Whilst inside, its units can replenish any losses at a faster rate and, if the settlement is attacked, will have improved morale. A garrisoned army suffers attrition when under siege if occupying a landlocked settlement or a port which is both under siege and blockade.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663221">You do not have to order each unit individually, commander! Group the army in a structured formation if it pleases you, or assign a portion of it to a subordinate.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1170317847">A closely-packed mass of troops is a superb target for missile units on the battlefield. Keep pounding them and they'll take casualties!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659123">The Lucanian ambush has failed, their capital is threatened! We must assist them with haste!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659423">Commander! The elephants are going into shock at the sight of the Indian breed! Pull them back immediately!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659623">Sir, Caesar has been wounded in action and carried to his tent by his guard. The men are demoralized to hear this news!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659923">The Gauls chose the wrong side and have paid the ultimate price. The route to the Samnite capital is clear, we shall find Rutilus soon.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660720">Good. You have the sense to use Rome's agents to achieve your ends!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660920">That was well done! The enemy siege weapons are yours!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661020">Good! Athena approves of cleverness in battle, like your flanking attack!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662520">That was well done, if you don't mind me saying so.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658024">Missions may be reviewed on the objectives panel. Although there is no penalty for failing, successful completion of a mission results in a reward, often in the form of bonus effects. If a mission cannot be completed due to factors outside of your control it will be cancelled.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661827">Good! This new building shows Egyptian superiority over all others!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662127">While Egypt is strong, allies are always welcome. Well done for this diplomatic triumph.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662327">Ba'al Hammon favours you. It is good that you have had your first sea battle!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663027">An army besieging a foreign settlement blocks trade income and traps its garrison within. Should the defenders sally out to counter-attack, the besieging army receives improved morale during the ensuing battle. Both sides suffer attrition in siege situations.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1212661715">Ordering the whole army to attack throws away any chance of gaining an advantage. Even if you have enough brute force to win, you will have lost many more men than you needed to.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2045097248">Repression is the enforcement of your rule by the presence of garrison troops and a useful tool for keeping populations in [[url:/manual/single-player/0044a_enc_page_campaign_play_province_public_order]]order[[/url]].</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2047305771">This option demands that a faction becomes your satrapy or client state,  taking advantage of your military might in exchange for a percentage of their income and, in the case of satrapies, unlimited military access. However, satrapies may find themselves dragged into a conflict not of their own design. Unlike a regular ally, they cannot decline a request to assist when war is declared on their overlord without automatically declaring war on their overlord themselves.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658825">The city, Silanus! The city must be saved!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659225">Their cavalry is charging along the riverbank! Intercept them, secure the flank!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660126">Macedon has presumed to exert its will over the people of Athens for far too long. Decisive action must be taken against them. They have established a defensive alliance with Sparta, but their relations will crumble if the Spartans believe that Greek independence is at stake. Epirus also poses a threat to the Peloponnesus; intervention there can only strengthen your ties with Sparta. Support all true Greek states and they will surely join you in your struggle against oppression. Athens will be free! </string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660626">It is clear that public order is low: the plebs will need to be appeased. Before they can be offered the carrot, however, they must be shown the stick. Destroy the rebel army!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661326">Our agent carried out the task! Well done!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661626">A rival dies at an assassin's hand. I am sure you had absolutely NOTHING to do with it. Well done.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662526">Wonderful! Sometimes crushing an enemy is the best solution!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662626">Truly, you are a credit to your father and his before him!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659426">The smell of the enemy's beasts was too much for our elephants! They have lost their heads and are running amok in confusion!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659626">The recruits will begin their training immediately, Tribune.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660625">Rome's glory is well served by your work in creating this building!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660725">This is very good. Your agent was successful!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660825">Give thanks to Neptune, but take due credit for your victory!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661025">Good! The enemy ship is sunk, and the waves look much more wholesome now!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662325">The port has been taken by your command! You have served Carthage well!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662525">There! You see what your men can do with proper leadership?</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662825">The equipment chain improves arms and armour production. Whilst the basic workshop unlocks new unit types, those buildings further down the chain offer improved armour, weapons and siege equipment for your armies.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663425">There are many ways to achieve victory at sea. Overwhelm the enemy with missiles, board and engage their crews hand-to-hand, or ram their vessels to sink them!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663525">The enemy cower in the town, inviting an attack. We will have to flush them out.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659827">The Gauls seek to make gains from us by allying with the Samnites? Their treachery will be their downfall, I will see it done!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660224">After grouping units you have the opportunity to hand that group over to AI control. In this case they are given a set of basic instructions, such as attacking a certain unit or defending a specific position. If an AI-controlled group destroys its target it will defend its current position until given further orders.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660424">Well done, you’ve used one of your agents.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660524">Congratulations, your army has reached another level of development.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661024">Good! You have won using beasts rather than men alone!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661224">Suppressing a rebellion is always cruel, but you had the strength to do it. Well done!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661824">Good! Rebels deserve nothing but harsh punishment! Well done!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662224">You have the cunning of Melqart! To win using beasts! Excellent!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662824">City centre buildings may be constructed in provincial capitals, and provide facilities and entertainment for the populace. Depending on your chosen faction, they can be developed in various ways, from trade and education, to slave markets and amphitheatres. Most city centre buildings improve public order and increase your cultural grip, agricultural output, and income.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663124">In addition to attributes, many units and ships have their own special abilities, that affect a variety of factors such as their morale or the damage they inflict. Many, such as the “Frenzied Charge”, improve the unit’s attack ability for a limited time. Special abilities are unlocked by researching military technologies in the campaign game. Many special abilities cannot be used again for a “cooldown” period, so it is important to use them sparingly and only at crucial moments.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658928">Attack, men, your consul watches over you! Strike down the Samnite invaders! Show them no mercy!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659028">Be advised! The Samnites raise more armies against us!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658929">The Samnites press further into Capua, they threaten the centre!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660829">Well done! Your army is well developed. Rome needs strong armies!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662428">Congratulations! You have taken the enemy siege equipment, a wise tactic!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662928">A military alliance is the strongest bond that can be made between two factions. Both parties swear allegiance to each other, guaranteeing military assistance should either start a war or be attacked themselves. Although it can only be formally ended by mutual agreement, failing to obey the terms of an active alliance not only breaks the agreement, but results in a severe diplomatic relations penalty.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663428">The population of this province is growing, Proconsul. Cities must expand and develop if they are to prosper. Well-managed urban centres are the engines of civilization.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1649185866">Terrain has an effect on a unit's movement speed. Sticking to roads or short grass will ensure your units move at maximum speed.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661933">You show a great lack of foolishness! It is wise to use agents!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662333">Carthage thanks you! Your army has reached a higher level of development.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662533">An agreement worthy of Ba'al's wisdom!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663133">Some units are able to adopt different formations that enhance their combat skills on the battlefield. For instance, wedge formation, originally devised by the Scythians and later known as the boar’s head, helps a cavalry charge break through enemy lines by reducing the surface area presented to the enemy at the point of impact, which also limits the damage caused by missiles fired or thrown in defence against it. The flying wedge is a variant of the same formation particular to Roman cavalry, with the same triangular shape hollowed out like an arrow head.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1247116376">When the enemy have a lot of fast, light troops or cavalry, consider moving your light infantry and skirmishers closer to other supporting units, so they don't get caught in the open.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659731">Silanus has fallen! A black day indeed! Men, retreat!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660132">The people of Epirus are fools. Having utterly failed to conquer Rome, they crawl back and presume to conquer Greece. To try is not to win. They will know this when you meet them in battle. Macedon may join you, but they are no better in the end: Alexander’s conquests have left them with delusions of grandeur. They will be checked, as will every other aggressor. You may fare better working with Athens and other true Greek states, but history has often taught otherwise. Ultimately, trust only in Sparta, and you will prevail.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660332">Silanus! Our men start to rout!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660532">Excellent, you have managed your economy well so your treasury is in profit.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660632">Moving troops away from the frontline is problematic: it will leave Salernum wide open to attack. Another army must be raised. A new commander must be appointed.</string>

The usual rules for deployment do not apply here: your forces will attack the enemy whilst they are in marching order. This is not always the best option to take in every situation. The enemy army will not be able to move until the battle begins, so deploy carefully to cause maximum confusion and disorder. </string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660231">War co-ordination goes further than alliances and requests to join wars, it enables factions to mark specific targets, such as a particular settlement or agent.

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663031">When a group of units is formed, you can give control to an AI commander and assign it the task of attacking the enemy or defending a position on the battlefield. The AI will then choose objectives for its group, react to nearby threats, and maintain control until the battle is over or the player takes back control. With a group selected, use the attack or defend button to select the AI’s stance, then left-click to select an enemy target or an area to defend.</string>

To achieve victory either kill or rout the entire army, or capture the central plaza. Before you begin, ensure that any siege weapons are positioned close enough to target the enemy defences.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659736">Congratulations are in order, Propraetor Silanus, for I understand that the Senate have appointed you to lead the invasion of Samnium. An easy choice to make, if I may say. The Senate wish for you to return the settlement of Salernum to us. It was overrun by the Samnites some years ago and its capture would again give Rome control of Campania.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660135">Your time has come. Recent setbacks in Magna Graecia compelled you to establish power on the Greek mainland. The Spartans think themselves superior to all others: they will know otherwise once you lay waste to their lands. The Athenians have become weak and would rather prattle than fight wars. They will fall in time, but may be of use against their Macedonian masters: the scions of Alexander still fancy themselves worthy of his empire and must be stopped. Perhaps, then, a mass invasion of the Italian peninsula: you have unfinished business with Rome and Syracuse. The enemies of Epirus will be subdued! </string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662935">When a faction agrees to become a satrapy or client state to another, it effectively agrees to serve as a subordinate. This means paying regular tribute to new overlords, and in the case of satrapies, breaking all alliances, non-aggression pacts, and military access pacts with other factions. Should an overlord come under attack, its subordinate is obligated either to assist in their defence or break their agreement, and, in the case of satrapies, declare war against them. If an overlord decides not to help a subordinate when a third party declares war on them, the agreement is broken. Whilst client states retain their diplomatic freedoms, a satrapy cannot instigate diplomacy apart from trade agreements with other factions.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663035">On the battlefield you can use the W, A, S and D keys to move the camera and left-click on units or their unit cards to select them. Move a selected unit by right-clicking on a location. Right-clicking on an enemy unit issues an attack order, whereas double-clicking will cause your unit to run or charge. To get an overview of the entire battlefield use the tab key or press the Tactical Map button.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663135">The general has a huge influence on his army’s fortunes in battle, not least because the abilities at his disposal can turn the tide in their favour. Each faction can unlock generals’ abilities and develop them in-line with skills and experience, sometimes upgrading them to become stronger or affect more units. There are two main types: powerful lingering abilities like “The Fear”, which can be used only a handful of times due to its longer cooldown time, and short impact boosts like “War Cry” that pass quickly but can be used many times.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659837">The Samnites will be fortifying the mountain passes inland from Salernum, but Buxentum to the south is relatively undefended.

Although food is automatically distributed across your territory, if total consumption is not matched by production then food shortages can occur, which can lead to unrest and, ultimately, [[url:/manual/single-player/0044a_enc_page_campaign_play_province_public_order#enc_text_manual_public_order_rebellions]]rebellion[[/url]].

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663039">The scale of any victory in battle is measured by the number of casualties suffered by each side. However, in siege, port siege and encampment battles the attacker can capture key positions known as victory points. When two thirds of the available victory points have been captured, or the only one in the case of minor settlements or encampment battles, the defenders’ victory tickets will start to diminish. The defender must reclaim their victory points to stop this happening or lose the battle when the number of tickets reaches zero.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663139">In a tribal society or a monarchy, your tribe or family branch could be challenged should they be deemed weak, leading to civil war.

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663002">An army ordered to carry out a forced march gets a significant increase in the action points available to it, but is unable to initiate a battle. Furthermore, a marching army has a reduced line of sight, reflecting its focus on the job in hand; the drawback being that it is more susceptible to ambushes. If attacked, all units in a marching army suffer reduced morale to reflect the inherent surprise element.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663502">Time is against us, Commander. This campaign has gone on for long enough, the men must rest.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139657902">An army transported by ship can launch an attack against an enemy port. Once the attack order has been given and the fleet has sailed to the coastline, your army will disembark and attack. It is not possible to withdraw from battle once this has occurred. Friendly armies aboard nearby ships cannot act as reinforcements. Only armies that have disembarked and are not already engaged in a coastal assault can reinforce them.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659302">Commander, we have men in the enemy docks!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660101">Your possessions are divided: you must secure additional territory to ensure their protection and to establish your faction as the supreme Mediterranean power. You are already at war with the Turdetani – capturing their settlement of Kartuba will further consolidate your position in Iberia. Relations are strained with Rome and Syracuse: you may find an ally in the Etruscan League should you choose to invade the Italian peninsula, and maintaining good relations with the Masaesyli and your African protectorates will prove vital should you need to repel an invasion. Carthage will prevail!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660701">Well done! You used beasts, not just men, to defeat the foe!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661901">Nicely done! That flanking attack was the right move!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662701">By Zeus and Hera! That was neatly done!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663101">Siege artillery units such as onagers can be recruited in the same manner as other units. However, siege engines are constructed on-site and deployed when assaulting enemy settlements. Ranging from simple battering rams to hulking siege towers, they directly connect with enemy walls, but are heavy, slow moving and vulnerable to attack. As such, it’s advisable to escort them lest the enemy sally out to meet their besiegers.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139657903">The enemy has launched a coastal assault against you. If you accept your force will move to engage the attackers. Refusal to take part in the battle will cause them to retreat.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663100">Chariots are the tanks of antiquity. Usually comprising of a driver, with at least one passenger armed with bow or javelin, they are best used to either disrupt the enemy’s front ranks prior to an infantry charge or as a skirmishing force. Ideally, chariots require space and flat terrain to ensure they can attack and swiftly withdraw to regroup. They should always avoid melee entanglements and any contact with heavy cavalry.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663500">Proconsul, you should consider recruiting a Champion to act on your behalf. Such a man will inspire the army to even greater feats of heroism.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660107">Your former vassals, Cyrenaica, have deigned to declare their independence and must be brought to heel. Cyprus remains true, but is at risk from invasion, as are your eastern possessions. The Seleucid Empire is a particular threat, a sprawling Successor Kingdom desperate to maintain power by whatever means possible; an alliance with Nabatea may help to keep them in check. Maintain trade relations with the Greek states and beware of Macedonian treachery, as they too may seek to gain control of Alexander’s former empire. Egypt shall be victorious!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660207">This option is a formal request to end hostilities between your faction and another.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662507">Good! You flanked them in fine style!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663007">Ambush stance immobilises an army but increases its line of sight and makes it invisible to nearby enemy forces. If undetected, a hidden army can attack any enemy that wanders into its zone of control. The success of such an ambush depends on the quality of the commanders involved and the nature of the surrounding terrain.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663107">Assault ships are the frontline of your fleet. Large vessels with strong hulls and fearsome rams, they carry the fight to the enemy, ramming their hulls whilst missile infantry in towers pepper the decks below. Finally, the boarding party leap aboard to finish off any survivors hand-to-hand.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1572526606">When attacking an enemy that is deployed on a hill, attack up the most gentle slope, even if it takes a while to get there. Fewer troops will be exhausted by the time they reach the top of the slope.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658805">The enemy must be routed! Target their flanks or attack them from behind!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662905">Trade between regions and other factions is vital to economic development and prosperity. A province automatically receives trade wealth based on its constituent buildings.

The Demetae have chosen to disrupt your peace and bring harm to your people, so stopping them must be your first order of business. The Brigantes are also unreliable and should be dealt with by any means possible. Finally, the Belgic Atrebates leave you little choice but war, after their many attempts to settle your lands. However, you share no bad blood with the Dumnonii, so they may prove valuable allies when you cross the narrow sea. By the will of Andraste, the Iceni will never yield!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660209">A confederation allows factions to join together for the common good, combining military resources to make all members stronger.

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662909">Slaves are a vital part of your labour force, enabling you to significantly boost your economy. Dealing with slaves is a double-edged sword, however, as enslaving enemy prisoners following battles or capture of their settlements can damage diplomatic relations with other factions of a similar culture. Slaves are automatically distributed across your empire. If their numbers grow too large there may be dissent amongst them, eventually leading to slave revolts if left unchecked. Revolts can also be incited by enemy champions, so it is vital to recruit dignitaries to counteract subterfuge in your territory.</string>

No matter, faced with hostility from Epirus, Sparta should remain true and may distract Epirus long enough for you to consolidate your rule at home. Conflict with the remaining Successor Kingdoms is inevitable and you must be ready, do not be afraid to seek military support from others if necessary.

War comes naturally to your people, and the tribes are ever at one another’s throats, but waging war will make your rivals more open to negotiation. However, your ultimate goal should be confederation: the joining of tribes to make a single stronger one. Under Suebi leadership, the people of Germania will rise up and crush their enemies!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663012">When ordered into a raiding stance, your army draws income from trade routes and nearby settlements. This decreases its upkeep costs, but reduces its defensive capabilities and movement range on the campaign map. When raid is selected, the routes and settlements that can be raided within a given radius are highlighted. The amount of booty gained is relative to the size of your army and is deducted from the income of the route or settlement in question. Marauding across foreign territory harms diplomatic relations, but isn’t an overt act of war. In dire situations, an army may raid within its own territory, causing a degree of public unrest as a result.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662418">You show the cunning of Ba'al himself! Capturing the enemy siege weapons! Excellent!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663018">When actively recruiting units into its ranks, an army is said to be “mustering”. Whilst in this stance it is immobile and cannot initiate an attack, but can defend and will replenish any losses at a quicker rate. An army cannot muster whilst undertaking a forced march, hiding to ambush or raiding.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663518">Ready yourselves, my soldiers, for we go to meet the enemy once more! The first man over the walls will lead the Triumph in Rome! To battle!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1412070137">As a unit fights and survives battles, it gains [[url:/manual/single-player/0028_enc_page_campaign_play_military_experience]]experience[[/url]] that improves its ability to deal with future combat situations. Amongst other things, experience increases morale, so an experienced unit is less likely to break and run from battle when under stress and fatigue.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659663">The Samnites are sending javelins against us. They mean to disrupt our line before their infantry engage.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659863">An excellent choice. This man can guard the home front and marshal any garrisons that the rebels may attack.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661667">Your agent now has a higher rank. Your efforts have been well rewarded!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662967">Depending on your faction’s culture, the first decision in your campaign may be the selection of a party to represent, which may take the form of a family or tribe. Alternatively, you will be assigned one. Throughout the campaign you must manage your party’s power in relation to the others such as the Senate, court or tribal council. While it is possible to achieve a balance of power, you may choose to push your party forward to gain more or sit back and allow its standing to diminish. In a republic, both paths can lead to conflict, whilst in a tribe or monarchy any show weakness may be challenged, again leading to civil war.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658765">The Samnites prepare their attack on the hillside. Their numbers are too strong for us to consider an engagement. I have enough men to defend a grain store, not assault an army.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663266">Grave news! Silanus has been wounded and carried from the field. The men lose heart!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663466">Silanus is lost! All of Rome is in mourning! We cannot continue without his leadership. Take down the marching camps and signal the retreat!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139657866">As an alternative to straight-forward occupation, upon capture of a settlement there is also an option to loot it. Doing so adds a lump sum to your treasury, but there will be a greater public order penalty than that caused by occupation alone.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659266">Do not count your arrows! Our baggage train carries many more, and can supply nearby units!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660365">Well done, you’ve negotiated military access through the territory of another.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661565">This peace treaty is a good thing for our people. Well done for this achievement.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662065">You have the cunning of a desert fox! To escape such an ambush! Well done!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662565">Tanit has blessed our people by sending you!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662865">By mastering the transportation and storage of water, you can develop sewer systems in urban areas and irrigate your crops to significantly increase your wealth from agriculture. The sanitation chain enables the construction of buildings that affect hygiene and safety. Constructing them in your provincial capital enables you to improve public order and increase province growth.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663065">The core of any army, an attack by highly-trained melee infantry often decides a battle, generally taking place once skirmishing and an initial charge by the frontline spearmen has occurred. Typically armed with swords, axes or clubs, with shields and armour for protection, the mobility of melee infantry makes them effective against slow-moving spearmen, whilst their armour is the crucial factor when facing other elite infantrymen. All non-spear infantry are vulnerable to cavalry charges, particularly to their flanks and rear.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663265">Silanus has been hurt in the melee! He will live, but word will surely spread through the soldiers!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661264">Good! Good! Our armies march where they will because of this treaty! Well done!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661764">Good! The settlement is taken! This is excellent news.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662064">The gods bless those who surprise the foe with a successful ambush! My congratulations!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662464">A well-ordered charge! That’s the way to do it!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662564">Superb! Ba'al enjoys seeing enemies crushed like that!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663364">Rome's influence and power grow, Silanus. Word of our deeds spreads amongst people far from our shores.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1629386802">It is possible to take a [[url:/manual/single-player/0044_enc_page_campaign_play_province_regions]]settlement[[/url]] without risking a pitched battle. A patient [[url:/manual/single-player/0047a_enc_page_campaign_play_characters_generals_admirals]]general[[/url]] can throttle the fight out of the defenders by laying siege for several turns. This is time-consuming, but eventually hunger or an angry populace will force a surrender.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659268">The Romans approach Carrhae! They must not take the town!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139658369">Since diplomacy with and war against other factions can only be undertaken when your respective territories are adjacent, you can increase your line of sight by sending fleets further along the coast or agents into unknown lands to encounter new factions. However, be careful not to go too far without back up, you may fall foul of hostile neighbours or suffer attrition if your ships stray too far from the coast.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659069">The new recruits have joined our army and are ready to be tested in battle. It will be a while before the Samnites arrive. We should take advantage of the delay and seek to further their training.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659669">We can use our cavalry to chase them off. They remain hidden from the enemy behind this hill.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660769">Good! One of your generals has a new household member or object.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662769">Superb! Mars would have been proud of a flanking attack like that!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663269">Sir! Word has reached us that the enemy general is dead, killed by our men! The enemy will surely panic without their leader!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663369">Roman power grows not just abroad, but in controlled territory as well. Edicts can be issued in major cities to promote the war effort at home.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1224585565">Running everywhere with your cavalry lets them cover ground quickly, but they will get tired if you overdo it. Tired troops are less effective in combat.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1259146729">This faction has now become your satrapy or client state, taking advantage of your military might in exchange for a percentage of their income and, in the case of satrapies, unlimited military access. However, satrapies may find themselves dragged into a conflict not of their own design. Unlike a regular ally, they cannot decline a request to assist when war is declared on their overlord without automatically declaring war on their overlord themselves.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660568">Well done, you’ve captured an enemy region. You are closer to control of the entire province.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139660668">Good! Peace with honour is important to Rome right now. A peace treaty is welcome.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661168">Ares approves of a man who can ambush like that! Well done!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661868">Good work. This treaty makes us stronger. Our armies can now march in their lands. </string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139661773">Our ways are dominant in this region! We must celebrate your achievement!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662173">A military treaty that lets our armies march freely is most welcome. You have done Carthage a great service.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1431102331">If an infantry unit is about to be charged by cavalry, make sure it is stationary. That way, the men can brace themselves against the impact and will take fewer losses.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659271">The enemy have wounded our general, commander, and he can no longer influence the battle! The news has already reached the men, they are disheartened!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662872">Whilst your armies protect threatened regions, your settlements have their own local garrisons to act as rudimentary defence forces. These men are stationed within a settlement and cannot leave their posts to join your armies on campaign. The types of garrison troops available depend on the buildings constructed in a particular settlement. Whilst not the most skilled soldiers, garrisons who defend against besieging forces will develop strength and experience over time. Ports have an equivalent garrison navy to protect against raids and naval blockades.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659372">Pompey cowers on that hill, it is up to us to seize the initiative and take the fight to him. For the glory of Rome!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662571">And that, my lord, shows that you are entirely worthy of command!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663071">A general will often go into battle accompanied by a mounted bodyguard, although some factions can attach them to a unit of powerful, elite infantry instead. A skilled general can affect the battle by his very presence. While his command unit is strong in melee, the general himself will have less influence on his army if he is personally involved in the fighting. Depending on the skills at his disposal, he can inspire and rally his men, and even improve the abilities of individual units.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1085557272">Be wary when attacking an enemy with their backs to the hills. Expect them to withdraw to the high ground.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_1255005425">Generals can inspire a single unit to increase the violence of their melee attack, improve reload rate and rate of fire, and ensure the unit's morale does not break for the duration of the effect. Select your general and then right-click on a unit. If the unit is not standing within the radius of his influence your general will move closer until it is. Once targeted, the unit will be inspired for a short time before the ability burns out.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662877">When an army attempts to cross the sea, a transport ship is automatically supplied to provide passage. While these ships are similar to military vessels, they are slower, more cumbersome and are unable to withstand sustained damage. With that in mind, transport ships require the protection of your fleets if they are to transport large armies across the sea. Selecting a fleet and right-clicking on a transport provides an armed escort for the journey: any attacks on the transport will have to face the fleet first.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663077">Lightly-armoured and armed with swords or spears, medium and light cavalry have good mobility and speed, making them an ideal force to screen and attack from the flanks of their army. Whilst they lack the punch required to make a frontal attack on an organised line, melee cavalry can be effective when charging its flanks or rear, or against a disordered or broken enemy. They can also be used to mercilessly chase down routers as they flee from the battle.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662976">If your party becomes too powerful in a republic, mistrust and paranoia ultimately lead to a challenge for control of your faction. At this point, civil war ensues; the remaining parties unite and lead rebel forces to capture the capital and overthrow your regime. Similarly, should you be deemed too weak, you may be exiled as an enemy of the state, with little choice but to lead your armies against the usurpers in the capital. In a tribal society or a monarchy, your tribe or family branch could be challenged should they be deemed weak, again leading to civil war. Such conflicts can only continue for a limited time, at which point they are automatically resolved by treaty, the terms of which are decided by the balance of power at the point of resolution.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663076">Heavily-armoured and armed with lances, these prestigious cavalry units should be kept in reserve and used sparingly so their impact is decisive. A cavalry charge into infantry lines can be devastating, but their intervention must be carefully timed to inflict maximum damage on the enemy. Despite their armour, shock cavalry should generally be kept clear of spearmen and are best used to charge weakened or disordered points in an enemy line. The heaviness of their armour means they will tire when engaged in prolonged melee combat, so, ideally, they should be withdrawn once their initial charge has hit home.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662975">Your party can gain power by completing missions, winning victories on the battlefield, and through political machinations back home. Generals with some experience can be left to lead your armies and fleets or be granted political office. While offices cause a gradual increase, a successful general provides a major boost to your party’s power during wartime. Although power can be left to accumulate, it can also be used to carry out agent actions, such as assassination, aimed at undermining the power of another party within your faction.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662983">Spy, dignitary and champion agents have unique abilities that significantly impact your campaign. Generally, they are used directly, but can also be activated simply by an agent's presence in a province, region or within an army. Every agent has a series of attributes, split into three categories: cunning, authority and zeal, which offer different approaches to actions upon the same target and shape the outcomes of those actions. These range from “astonishing success” to “critical failure”, resulting in wounds that force it out of play to convalesce or cause its death.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663483">Public order has hit rock-bottom and the people here are in open revolt, Silanus! We have no choice now but to send armed forces to quell the uprising!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662982">Subjects are characters that take part in the your faction’s life and politics. Appearing throughout the game in political dilemmas, they provide a range of bonuses or penalties that can be increased or decreased depending on what you choose to do with them. If a subject dies his effects are removed from the campaign. There is also a chance this will happen if you threaten him, blackmail him, or if he starts to support your party.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662887">As a general gains experience by leading your armies into battle, his rank and skills develop across three distinct disciplines. The “Commander” develops his influence over his troops in battle, improving his ability to inspire and rally them. The “Strategist” develops across a campaign by reducing recruitment costs, speeding-up unit replenishment, and increasing army movement extents. The “Warmonger” has influence on both the battle and campaign maps, using his growing reputation to improve unit abilities and reduce the enemy’s morale on the battlefield, whilst increasing happiness throughout friendly regions and provinces. Your general can progress evenly in each discipline or choose to specialise in a single area.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663287">As our armies push further into the hills and mountains of Samnium we would do well to reconnoitre the terrain ahead. You should consider recruiting a spy to gather information in enemy territory, Silanus.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139659786">Proconsul Gaius Fulvius Silanus! Your campaign against the Samnites has been so impressive it's little surprise that the Senate have chosen to place full civil and military power in your hands.

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663085">Spear and pike units are generally best put into tight formations to present a virtually impenetrable barrier. Often present on the frontline, and advancing as soon as the skirmishing phase has ended, they are supremely effective against cavalry. However, their lack of mobility can be exploited by skirmishers and, particularly, more agile melee infantry when in close combat. As movement is limited, the flanks and rear of spear and pike units are also particularly vulnerable, so should always be screened by more mobile troops.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663285">Terrible news! Our commander is slain by the enemy! We have recovered the body, but word has spread through the army!</string>

As it wins victories on the battlefield, this legacy increases through the establishment of traditions. Some of these are unique to certain factions, and affect specific different aspects of battles and campaigns. An army’s legacy forever remains with its emblem, living on long after its original troops have succumbed to their fates. When a new army is raised, you can choose to hand down the legacy of a former army to your newest recruits.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139663091">Lightning fast, agile skirmishers, missile cavalry are best deployed on the flanks of your army, harassing an enemy line from a distance in the early stages of a battle.

Best used against a disordered foe or to help screen the flanks of your army, they should be kept in reserve and out of the enemy’s reach until called upon. Due to their size, these beasts are best matched against heavy infantry: enemy skirmishers and light cavalry can defeat them with their fast, nimble attacks. Elephants can run amok if sufficiently hurt or frightened by the enemy. To stop them trampling your own troops you can use the Kill Elephant ability.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139662895">A province consists of up to four regions, each one containing a settlement. One of these is always the provincial capital, a major, walled settlement, whilst the remainder are minor settlements without defensive walls. Building construction improves both the strategic and economic potential of a settlement and enables it to grow. Over time, provincial growth enables you to develop settlements, either by upgrading existing buildings or by constructing additional ones. Depending on the resources available, different types of buildings can be developed. Coastal settlements can also contain port buildings. When a faction owns an entire province, provincial edicts may be issued. Lasting for a single turn, they nevertheless have powerful effects, such as increased tax income or improved public order. The number of edicts that can be issued per turn depends on your faction’s imperium.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-594453008">When in [[url:/manual/single-player/0092l_enc_page_battle_play_interface_skirmish]]skirmish[[/url]] mode, troops avoid getting into [[url:/manual/single-player/0092j_enc_page_battle_play_interface_melee]]melee[[/url]] by keeping their distance from the enemy and attacking with arrows, javelins or sling shot. When a unit of missile troops is selected the skirmish mode button will appear. It can be toggled on or off.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_44290589">A cavalry unit moving quickly across the field of fire is not a sensible target for missile units. You may kill a few enemies, but better look instead for a tightly-packed target unit, one at a standstill, or coming head-on towards you.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_68074087">As the main administrative centre in a [[url:/manual/single-player/0044_enc_page_campaign_play_province_regions]]region[[/url]], the settlement contains both [[url:/manual/single-player/0046_enc_page_campaign_play_province_trade_finance]]trade[[/url]] and [[url:/manual/single-player/0020_enc_page_campaign_play_military]]military[[/url]] buildings. Settlements are the main consumer of [[url:/manual/single-player/0044_enc_page_campaign_play_province_regions]]food[[/url]] supplies in a province, so it is vitally important to keep food-production buildings upgraded to avoid shortages.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_17591341">Cavalry cause extra casualties when first charging in due to the impetus of their attack. A cycle of charge, withdraw, charge causes maximum casualties for minimum losses. Repeat until done.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_97123942">The battle timer shows how much time is left before the battle ends. The attacker must rout or destroy the defender within the time limit or lose the battle. To claim victory the defender has only to keep the attacker at bay, so can still win even if outnumbered.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1567524386">Lower quality infantry are useful for engaging and holding the enemy in place while you go around their side or rear. However, the lower the troop quality, the less time you have before they break and rout.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1394403499">There is a port in this [[url:/manual/single-player/0044_enc_page_campaign_play_province_regions]]region[[/url]] that has not been developed to its full potential.

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1395907252">The food production buildings across your territory are not producing enough to supply all your settlements, resulting in food shortages. As a matter of urgency, upgrade them to increase food supply, as persistent hunger will lead to increased discontent.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1961998855">Light cavalry are an excellent choice for riding down light infantry and skirmishers. They often screen the main enemy force or harry isolated units, so getting rid of them is always a sound tactic, if you can catch them!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-2014914668">Placing cavalry units on your flanks gives you flexibility. They can counter any flanking move or make a move of their own if the way is clear.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1030015586">Guard mode ensures that units fight defensively, try to maintain their formation when attacked and won't pursue the enemy if they run away. It can be toggled on or off by selecting a unit and clicking on the guard mode button.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1341063580">Light cavalry make excellent bait. You can lure the enemy into ambushes, draw units out of position in their line, or just make them tire themselves out chasing you.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-2039862233">Battle statistics are displayed here, along with the options to [[url:/manual/single-player/0021_enc_page_campaign_play_military_sieges#enc_text_manual_army_attack_capture_occupy]]occupy[[/url]] or [[url:/manual/single-player/0021_enc_page_campaign_play_military_sieges#enc_text_manual_army_attack_capture_loot]]loot[[/url]] if you have captured a settlement.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1002927119">Enemy trade ships are fair game in times of war. Once the trade route is within your radius of influence, enter raid stance to draw additional income from raiding their trade fleets.</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1243953931">This option is used to broker military alliances. This allows you to call on an ally to provide assistance when at war, and likewise. Note that a refusal to provide military support when asked will instantly cancel the alliance between you.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1076388291">Skirmish mode means your skirmishers will try to avoid hand to hand contact with the enemy by retreating to a safe firing distance. Try to keep some melee troops close behind them, so your skirmishers can run back through their lines to safety when threatened.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1442955838">Maintaining a unit's courage and discipline in the heat of battle is dependent on their morale - a measure of pride and belief in their abilities. This is boosted by training, experience and the presence of an inspirational commander. Morale is weakest when a unit is heavily outnumbered or outmatched by an enemy. You can see their morale state just above their unit flag.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1961571108">Following a new agreement a trade route has been opened between you and your new trading partner. Guard it well, as your enemies will attempt to raid it, potentially ruining your economy.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1744509802">The enemy will often try to flank your formation with cavalry, so it's a good idea to have infantry reserves on the ends of your line ready to intercept them.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1009457400">If a flanking manoeuvre by cavalry is countered, for example by enemy infantry moving to intercept, abort the move but leave them in a threatening position. You will have tied down some of their units for no cost.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-2134517828">Provoke a defending enemy into unwise attacks by enraging them. Light infantry and other skirmishers or missile cavalry are good troops to provoke this response.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1899489232">When troops are surrounded during hand-to-hand combat, they will fight to the death as they have nowhere left to run! Beware though, as desperate men may also be dangerous men!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1467085177">Where the enemy are concentrated, prepare a defensive line; where they are strong, avoid them. Attack where they are unprepared.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1381776408">Control of the camera on the campaign map is simple. Use W to move the camera forward and S to move it backward. A and D strafe sideways.

Use X and Z or the mouse wheel to zoom in closer.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1246754910">Often the best tactic is to encircle the enemy and shoot them from behind or in the flanks. If they turn or chase you off, their formation will be disrupted, leaving them vulnerable to the attentions of your cavalry.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1241185070">This panel gives you important information about a particular unit type: number of men, [[url:/manual/single-player/0017_enc_page_campaign_play_military_recruit]]recruitment[[/url]] and upkeep costs, [[url:/manual/single-player/0028_enc_page_campaign_play_military_experience]]experience[[/url]], statistics, unit abilities, and a detailed description.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1282356525">The mobility and stamina of light cavalry makes them ideally suited to scouting the battlefield. If they stumble into a sticky situation their light mounts should be swift enough to get them clear of danger.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1060140303">Feigning a rout by sacrificing a unit is a sure way of enticing a defender out of a strong defensive position, or luring an attacker into an ambush. Beware though, a feigned rout can quickly become a real one.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1890476358">When attacking across a river, try to soften up the enemy on the far bank by bombarding them with missiles first. Once they are weakened, your assault has a better chance of succeeding.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1871866990">The overall happiness of a population is influenced by a variety of different contributing factors including taxation, [[url:/manual/single-player/0044a_enc_page_campaign_play_province_public_order#enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_culture]]cultural[[/url]] differences and devastation following conquest, food shortages, [[url:/manual/single-player/0044_enc_page_campaign_play_province_regions#enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_slaves]]slaves[[/url]], the presence of entertainment buildings, squalor, and the actions of enemy agents.

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1701749777">It is important to preserve the devastating impact a cavalry unit can have. When going into combat with cavalry, always charge the last few yards by double right-clicking on the target. Beware of charging across too great a distance though, it's a tiring business!</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1969897884">Attacking spear-equipped infantry in the flanks is a good way of taking them on with cavalry. You should always avoid charging onto sharp, pointy weapons that can be braced!</string>

<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1906180227">Cavalry are not good at defending a static line. Don't put them in a defensive line unless you're expecting to charge them out. If so, have infantry ready to plug the gap they leave behind.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1070740040">The penalty for breaking an alliance is greater the longer the agreement has been in place. Trust grows over time, so the higher the esteem your faction is held in, the further it has to fall when things sour.</string>
<string name="advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1666667854">Lower quality infantry make great targets for the enemy to waste their missiles on. They can protect high value units by drawing fire.</string>
