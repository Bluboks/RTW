<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_navy_canvas_sails">Strong backs were useful when ships were near the coast or navigating rivers, but sails proved far more efficient on long sea journeys. They could be raised and lowered quickly and, with a good wind, could propel a ship much faster and further than a crew of oarsmen. Yet, strong backs and oars were still favoured in battle; wind could not be relied upon and oars were perfect for positioning ships for ramming attacks and for short, sharp bursts of speed. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_civil_druidism_knowledge_of_the_oak">The oak tree was revered by the druids, who believed that the plants which grew on it were signs from the gods. Mistletoe was the most sacred of all these plants and gathering it was an important druidic ritual. The chief druid used a golden hook to remove the sprigs of mistletoe from the oak; they were then carefully caught in a white cloth, as they were never allowed to touch the ground. As a gift from the gods, mistletoe was thought to be a remedy for any known poison, as well as a cure for impotency. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_siege_emergency_siege_measures">"For the defenders, sieges are terrible times. Starvation is a constant threat: what food is within the walls is all that there will be until the siege is ended. Those who cannot fight must be made to leave, preferably before the siege begins. Food supplies then last longer. 

At the Battle of Alesia in 52BC the decision to expel women and children from the fortifications was made too late. Throwing out non-combatants meant more food for the fighters, but the Romans would not allow refugees through their lines. The women and children starved in the no-man’s land between the two armies. Their agonies were watched, from the safety of the walls, by their own menfolk."</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_engineering_top_earth_works">The ancient Celts created a wide variety of earthworks of many sizes. Some, like hill forts, were used to improve the defences of a settlement and could cover as much as 19 hectares. Mounds and long barrows, on the other hand, were much smaller and were used specifically for burials. The purpose of some earthworks, like henges and stone circles, remains mysterious even today, although it is widely believed that had a ritual purpose. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_economy_common_currency">There is some debate as to the exact origins of the first coins, although it is widely accepted that some of the Mediterranean’s earliest coinage came from Lydia in Asia Minor. The first Greek coinage was produced on the island of Aegina, some 24km south of Athens. Aegina was a trading nation that minted a coin known as the “turtle”, named for the sea-turtle design punched into it. Pebble-like in appearance these early coins were made from electrum, an alloy of gold and silver. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_tactics_rites_of_melqart">Hannibal was a great believer in the powers of Melqart, a Carthaginian deity often equated to the Greek hero Hercules. The Roman historian Livy recorded Hannibal’s preparations before his great march into Italy, and chief among them was a visit to Gades to lay offerings at the Altar of Melqart. According to legend Hannibal was visited by a dream on the eve of his journey, a ghostly visitor bade him follow and not look back. Hannibal’s curiosity got the better of him and on turning back he saw a great serpent destroying all in its path. He asked the spectre what this vision meant and was told it was the desolation of Rome by mighty Carthage. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_engineering_construction_fired_brick">The Romans inherited their knowledge of brick making from the Etruscans. Distrustful of a foreign technique, early Roman fired bricks were made from roof tiles which had already proven durable. By the Republican era fired bricks were widely used thanks to the perfection of a baking process which allowed them to absorb the mortar in cement. Roman bricks were standardised and came in four sizes, ranging from the “bassalis” which was eight Roman inches square or around 20cm, right up to the “bipedailis” which was two Roman feet square, around 60cm. Roman brick-makers often stamped their bricks with their names and dated them by adding the names of the consuls in office at the time.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_economy_perennial_irrigation">Basic irrigation systems were widespread in the ancient world because they were simple to maintain. Perennial irrigation was rarer, and required longer canal systems, a method of storage and better maintenance to ensure that silt and salt build-up was kept in check. In Mesopotamia, the river system was able to supply water to the surrounding arable land in the dry season through a system of canals, closed off by dykes and sluice gates. Water was stored in reservoirs, either natural or man-made, and then lifted into the irrigation channels. While this was a labour-intensive task, the results of such toil were remarkable and hugely beneficial to harvests in the area.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_construction_dioptra">The dioptra was first used by the Greek astronomers to fix the position of the stars. However, when this was superseded by a more accurate device, the armillary sphere, it found a new function as a surveying tool. It was a portable instrument that could be used to measure distances, angular measurements or work as a level. The dioptra could assess both the horizontal and vertical planes, allowing for readings of the deviation between two set locations, so offering accurate measurement of any angles involved. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_civil_economy_annual_survey">The written word played a vital part in the administration of Egyptian lands, not least as a tool of taxation. An annual census gave the government a chance to survey the nation, and collect the information required to ensure that taxes could be levied effectively. Despite a population of over three million, the census found and recorded everyone from the poorest farmer to the richest landowner. Nobody could hide from the New Kingdom’s bureaucratic reach as the census, administered by a vast system of overseers and scribes, measured Egypt’s financial growth and prosperity.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_philosophy_cult_of_alexander">After liberating them from Persian tyranny Alexander the Great was instantly revered by the Egyptian people. Only 20, he was seen as their saviour, anointed as Pharaoh and declared the son of Amun-Ra.  In 331BC Alexander founded the city of Alexandria and the veneration by the Egyptians was the catalyst for his quest to achieve divine status. It had long been rumoured that he was the son of Zeus, and it was this divine parentage that led to the growth of a personality cult that helped Alexander unite and rule all his conquered lands. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_construction_improved_fortifications">The need for buildings and settlements to withstand and repel attacks led to the construction of many impressive defensive structures. The formidable twin walls of Babylon were an early example of such practices. One of the seven wonders of the ancient world, its multi-layered defences were built from baked brick and reinforced by a surrounding moat. It was stated by Greek historian Diodorus that such construction took two hundred thousand men a full year to complete. On standing before them, Cyrus the Great, commander of the besieging Medo-Persian forces exclaimed “I am unable to see how any enemy can take walls of such strength and height by assault”. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_management_mercenaries">Mercenaries have existed for thousands of years but the earliest written record of them dates back to the seventh century BC, when Greek hoplites sought employment as bodyguards serving Pharaohs and Greek tyrants alike. Mercenaries became a great way to bolster troop numbers during times of war, something the Carthaginians resorted to during their war with Rome. They exploited their trade links to recruit troops from the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic islands. The Romans were more sparing with their use of mercenaries, but acknowledged the shortcomings within the legion, notably archers and cavalry, by making up for the lack with carefully chosen mercenary troops. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_siege_onager">Roman siege equipment was, with the exception of some specialist pieces, always constructed on campaign. This meant that those who were expected to use the siege equipment needed a good level of engineering knowledge. As well as a working knowledge of the workings of their machinery they were expected to carefully manage the projectiles, making sure that they were the correct weight and could achieve the range required.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_military_war_exercises_battle_fury">The Gaesatae were a group of elite Gallic warriors renowned for their ferocity. Their name roughly translates as spearman and they were mercenaries who fought against the Romans. They were infamous for going into battle completely naked, an act that the Romans wrongly attributed to a desire to be unencumbered; it was actually a way for the Gaesatae to increase their contact with the earth. Greater contact with Mother Nature ensured their rebirth into the Otherworld should they perish in the mortal one. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_agriculture_land_reclamation">Throughout the ancient world there was a drive to find new exploitable land, either through clearing forests or, more frequently, draining lakes, marshes and flooded plains. The Greeks set their sights on draining Lake Copais, a swampland north of Athens that was flooding fertile land around it as the natural flow of water was blocked due to regular earthquakes. In 325BC an engineer, Crates, sought to solve the problem by supplementing the natural drainage in the area with a long tunnel. The work was halted by the military ambitions of Alexander the Great but resumed centuries later. In 1890 the lake was finally drained and the area is now used for farming.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_construction_monumental_architecture">Advancing architectural techniques, together with improved transport, removed some limits on monumental building works. With organised mass labour, monuments could be constructed on a vast scale. Egyptian tombs and pyramids are some of the earliest examples of monumental architecture in the ancient world. The Greeks built magnificent temples, triumphal arches and monumental columns, as did the Romans. Such monuments were often erected to honour deities or victorious leaders. In conquered lands, they were an effective way of overawing the subject population and reminding them of their loyalties. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_tribal_council_intensified_production">Many historians believe that the increase in production of consumables like pottery and jewellery in Celtic society was directly linked to an increase in contact with Rome. Trade with Rome had its benefits and tribal leaders began to use their resources to make trade goods. Iron from Britain made it as far afield as Carthage in North Africa, proving that the ancient Celts knew more about trade than Roman writers, like Caesar and Strabo, believed. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_tribal_council_timber_trackway">The Celts were prolific road builders, sadly their trackways were constructed from wood and few have survived the ravages of time. Luckily, some passed through bogs and it is here that we have been able to learn more about the Celtic track ways. The Corlea bog in Ireland is home to one of the best preserved Celtic timber track ways; the tree-rings on the wood point to a tree-felling date of 148 BC, long before the Romans arrived and began building their stone roads. Some historians believe that Roman roads may have been built over the original timber track ways.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_navy_deck_artillery">The Hellenistic world was at the forefront of construction when it came to huge war galleys bristling with artillery. Alexander the Great used catapults from his ships when he besieged Tyre in 332BC, and it was the Greeks who built the most formidable floating fortress of the time, the Syracusia. Designed by inventor Archimedes this huge transport vessel was said to be 55 metres in length. It featured a raised fighting deck that housed a giant catapult capable of switching between firing a five metre dart or a 80 kilogramme stone missile. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_agriculture_improved_irrigation">In its most basic form, irrigation takes water from an available natural source and diverts it to crops through man-made channels or ponds. The Egyptians had little need for such methods thanks to the River Nile which naturally flooded their farmlands every year. The Egyptians perfected systems that diverted the flooding of the Nile to irrigate their crops and deposit the river’s nutrient-rich silt. For those less fortunate, engineering offered the opportunity to improve on primitive methods. The most effective early techniques involved the building of diversion dams that could channel water from a river or stream into a canal.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_siege_improved_defensive_artillery">As armies strengthened their siege engines and developed artillery capable of pummelling settlement walls, defenders were forced to adapt their tactics and equipment to counter the threat. A gateway flanked by towers was no longer enough to repel a determined foe. Defensive towers and platforms grew to accommodate not only archers and slingers, but also artillery engines as well. During the siege of Lilybaeum in 274BC, the Carthaginians placed catapults along the length of their walls to fend off the armies of Pyrrhus; his men were forced to abandon the attack by the weight of the defensive artillery bombardment.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_agriculture_seeding_plough">The seed plough allowed ancient farmers to minimise their hours of toil, enabling them to turn the soil, deposit seeds into the furrow and turn back the soil in one pass. A Mesopotamian invention, it is said that the god Enlil provided the inspiration for the device by outlining his designs in the stars. While this invention saved both time and resources, it also made ploughing a skill in its own right, which contributed to the growth of specialisation in agriculture. Regions began to organise their skilled workers and natural resources to focus on a single crop.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_war_exercises_trimarcisia">Trimarcisia is the Celtic practice of taking two ‘servants’ in to battle to act as attendants and was first recorded by the Greek writer Pausanias. He described the actions of the Celtic cavalry at the Battle of Thermopylae and explained that each mounted warrior had two servants, who were skilled riders in their own right. These servants remained behind the ranks until their charge needed a new mount, was injured or killed. If the warrior took a wound one of the riders would take him back to camp while the other took his place in battle. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_tactics_ship_ram">Ancient warships were designed around a bow ram that was shoved into the hull of enemy ships to puncture and immobilise them. A ramming attack demanded an experienced and well-drilled crew, because the speed and angle of the collision were vital to the effectiveness of the attack, with some angles demanding higher speeds. However, as ships became larger, heavier and more impervious to ramming, naval warfare began to mirror the land battles of the time. Ships became mobile platforms for artillery and the hand-to-hand combat skills of the crew became the key to naval supremacy</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_construction_improved_material_transportation">The location, and scale, of building projects was influenced by a number of factors, not least availability of building materials. Quarrying techniques improved, and the transportation of materials became easier, thanks to a vast network of canals. Improved carts and wagons helped to improve overland transport, as did the introduction of safe trade routes. However, land routes remained more expensive and physically demanding than their water equivalents, and waterways became the favoured method of material transportation.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_farming_celtic_plough">The Celtic plough was an incredibly advanced piece of farm machinery, considering that the earliest records of its use were found on the Camonica rock carvings, in Val Camonica, north of Milan. While many societies continued to use ploughs with wooden shares, the blade of the plough, the Celts had developed shares made of iron. They also introduced the coulter, a sharp knife that made a vertical cut and turned the soil over on itself, this innovation saved farmers a huge amount of time and effort as a field could now be ploughed in one pass instead of two or more. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_economy_denominational_system">In 420BC the Greeks made their first attempt to introduce a standardised currency. The Romans, while slower to adopt coinage, soon realised the need for a system of fixed coinage and minted their coins to be worth the weight of their gold and silver “bullion” content. This, unfortunately, lent itself to a gradual debasement of the coinage as the more corrupt states began to mint their own, alloying the metals in the coins to maintain weight while using the spare gold and silver to make more debased coins.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_engineering_construction_hill_forts">The remains of hill forts have been found all over Europe and excavations undertaken in and around them have shown that they were not simply defensive sites.  Some were only occupied seasonally and appear to have had a religious significance, like Dún Aonghasa in County Galway, Ireland. Others were permanent settlements that contained homes, forges and craft workshops and some, like Maiden Castle in the English county of Dorset, became bases of operation for the Roman invasion.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_engineering_siege_ammunition_stores">Artillery provided defenders with greater firepower, but created a need to produce and store large amounts of ammunition. Stone balls of varying sizes were stored within fortifications for use when the time came. Excavations in Carthage and the Greek city of Dora provide evidence that large-scale production of ammunition took place in order to prepare for the onset of any siege. Over 5600 artillery balls have been found within the site of Carthage; they predate the Roman attack on the city that burnt it to the ground in 146BC. </string>

As a ship building material it provided incredible hull strength, which was vital for ships sailing the rough Atlantic tides. Both Caesar and Strabo wrote of the strength of the warships built by the Veneti tribe, stating that ramming attacks did very little damage to the strong oak hulls, forcing the Romans to develop new tactics to defeat the Veneti. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_engineering_construction_enclosed_settlement">The Aedui built an impressive settlement known as Bibracte near Burgundy in France; its walls were thought to be five kilometres in circumference and five metres high. Inside, the city was dominated by the royal palace and its streets were packed with craftsmen, jewellers and ironworkers. Archaeologists have been able to study this site extensively owing to the fact that the initially pro-Roman Aedui avoided the treatment of the many tribes who fought against the Roman occupation of Gaul.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_tribal_council_land_and_community_laws">Ancient Celtic society was built on agriculture, and many of its laws dealt with this important aspect of life. Clearly identifying the boundaries between farmland was paramount and so boundary pillar stones were erected. In Ireland Cormac mac Cuileannanin’s ‘Sanas Chormaic’ gave them the name ‘gallan,’ as they were first erected by the Gauls when they arrived in Ireland. This type of stone has also been found in England and Scotland and they often have names engraved on them in ‘Ogham.’</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_tactics_tactical_flexibility">The heavy phalanx did not disappear from the Hellenistic world overnight, but there was a definite move to compliment it with more flexible and mobile fighting forces, made up of light troops and cavalry. Greek armies began to equip their troops with lighter armour and placed greater emphasis on skirmishing and one-on-one combat. They developed the “thureophoroi” infantryman, a soldier equipped with the oval thureos shield, thought to be modelled on the Roman scutum. More mobile than a hoplite, these men could protect and reinforce the phalanx, attack an enemy from the flanks and generally bridge the gap between the heavy spearman and the light peltast skirmisher. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_navy_marine_training">The marines of ancient Greece were paid volunteers who tended to be from the lower citizen classes. This was possibly because they were more likely to be available for naval service because they were not liable for regular hoplite service. Fighting from the deck of a moving ship required skills that could only be developed through experience, so it is likely that the soldiers employed by Greek navies made their living as marines. Despite their low birth, marines were next to the captain in a ship's hierarchy and took part in ceremonies and political discussions. Thucydides even called the marines of one fleet “the best men” to fall in the Peloponnesian War.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_engineering_siege_siege_tower">Siege towers were huge feats of engineering, sometimes reaching six storeys in height. Any defenders seeing one approaching would instantly do all in their power to halt the tower's advance. Flaming arrows and boiling oil were obvious choices, which allowed the Romans to develop defensive countermeasures for towers. Wet cow skins were often fixed to the frame and men were stationed inside the tower equipped with water hoses made of pickled cow intestines to put out fires.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_tactics_strategic_manoeuvres">While battles were traditionally fought on vast, open landscapes, there were exceptions and a clever strategist could use these to his advantage. Terrain was an effective form of defence, with high ground, woods and forests used to protect the rear and flanks of an army, particularly when faced with a highly mobile opponent, well provided with cavalry. Such features could also offer cover for ambush attacks, and knowledge of the terrain became a key factor in the success of the Germans and Gauls who used guerrilla tactics to counter the organised ranks of the Roman army. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_tactics_pike_phalanx">Traditionally, the Greek phalanx attacked en masse in close order. Over time this tactic evolved to take on more complex forms: the Thebans adopted an oblique phalanx formation under the leadership of Epaminondas; this placed the greatest density of troops on the left wing of the phalanx to strike the enemy on their traditionally powerful right. This was used to great effect against the Spartans at the Battle of Leuctra. Epaminondas arranged his troops 50 men deep on the left to take on Sparta’s most experienced and fearsome warriors. This unexpected shift of tactics won him the battle and helped to disprove the myth that Spartan warriors were invincible.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_siege_armoured_siege_engineers">Large torsion-powered catapults and siege engines were powerful weapons that could devastate densely packed enemies in open battle, or topple walls during sieges. However, these were heavy and cumbersome machines, requiring large operating crews. Loading and firing took time and left the crew members vulnerable to enemy attacks, particularly from fast-moving cavalry. Placing other units nearby to guard the crew members went some way to protecting them, but arming them and improving their personal armour allowed them to protect themselves.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_navy_greek_fire">Greek fire was a mix of liquid chemicals that could be siphoned from a cauldron, sprayed through a tube and then ignited. It was capable of clinging fast to all materials and could burn through the flesh of a man in seconds. The flames were seemingly inexhaustible, and its victims had little hope of putting them out as dousing with water was futile. Greek fire was able to burn on and under water, making it an effective naval weapon. Those brave enough to use it could create swathes of flame which would rapidly consume any ships they touched.</string>

Nations with hoplite-heavy armies believed dancing and athletics were sufficient to prepare a man for battle. Roman generals took a slightly different view. Legionaries trained with a wooden sword, twice the weight of a battle weapon, against a wooden post. They would train for hours, practising stabs, thrusts and feints against their immobile opponent. This would then progress to fencing practice with other recruits, using swords with covered tips, before the legionary would take his honed weapon skills into full mock battles.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_siege_battering_ram">Battering rams in their simplest form have existed for millennia. Some clever individual discovered that running a large log at gates seemed to be an effective way of knocking them down. It was only a short time until bigger and better designs appeared, usually involving decorating the ram with a ram's head. The Macedonians made many advances in siege craft, including the introduction of the covered battering-ram, the cunning invention of Polyidus of Thessaly who served Philip II of Macedon.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_philosophy_philosophers">The great Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato and Aristotle shaped what we define as modern-day philosophy. By questioning the firmly-held belief that the gods were responsible for everything, and suggesting more rational explanations for day-to-day events instead, the philosophers had a profound effect on society. Not surprisingly these new ideas were not welcomed by all and some philosophers were persecuted for their corrupting influence. Socrates was sentenced to death by an Athenian jury, but his work inspired Plato who went on to create a school of thought that changed governmental practices and addressed the welfare of society. </string>

All of these monuments were constructed in a time before heavy mechanical aids and they have stood the test of time. Some, like the Great Pyramid, have left historians slightly baffled as to how they were constructed whereas others give real insight into the civilisations that constructed them.

Archiving records and documents became crucial to maintaining legal institutions and promoting further learning. The first libraries and archives were set up locally, collecting the information pertinent to the surrounding area. The most significant universal archive of information in the ancient world was the Library of Alexandria, which was said to have housed over half a million documents and scrolls.

What they neglect to mention is the Celtic tradition of deciding battles through single combat. A brave champion would step from the ranks and present his challenge, boasting of his great deeds and those of his ancestors before him. Once the two champions had done battle the victor would win the war for his tribe and they would return home. However, the Romans did not hold to these traditions and even if a Celtic champion beat a Roman in single combat they would fall on the unsuspecting Celts and exact revenge for their fallen comrade.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_navy_improved_ship_building">The model boats discovered in Celtic hordes not only give us an idea of how barbarian vessels may have looked, they also reveal the important role played by the sea in Celtic mythology.  Bodies of water were seen as pathways to the Otherworld and any islands found on these pathways were viewed as places of mystery and magic. The inhabitants of the British coast believed that a series of small islands in the Bristol Channel were Otherworld realms. The magic of these islands can be explained, in part, by the sea mists that still obscure them from time to time, making them completely disappear. </string>

The chief druid used a golden hook to remove the sprigs of mistletoe from the oak; they were then carefully caught in a white cloth, as they were never allowed to touch the ground. As a gift from the gods, mistletoe was thought to be a remedy for any known poison, as well as a cure for impotency. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_construction_monumental_architecture">Advancing architectural techniques, together with improved transport, removed some limits on monumental building works. With organised mass labour, monuments could be constructed on a vast scale. Egyptian tombs and pyramids are some of the earliest examples of monumental architecture in the ancient world. The Greeks built magnificent temples, triumphal arches and monumental columns, as did the Romans. Such monuments were often erected to honour deities or victorious leaders. In conquered lands, they were an effective way of overawing the subject population and reminding them of their loyalties. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_engineering_construction_tax_labour">Taxation becomes futile when a populace are too poor to pay taxes. At such times the poor were forced to work unpaid to help complete civil projects. Such measures were common practice in the ancient world; in Egypt the Pharaoh would be merciless in the taxation of his subjects. Peasants were expected to work several days a month to help maintain roads and canals and to lend their muscle to construction and mining. Some governments could be strict in the extreme when imposing tax labour: in Babylonia, failure to fulfil labour obligations would see a man forfeit his lands. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_construction_advanced_construction_techniques">As building materials became more understood and skills developed amongst architects and builders, new construction techniques became possible. Domes, arches and vaults became regular features in Roman architecture but a true dome was perhaps the pinnacle achievement of architects and builders of the time. They posed complex puzzles when it came to supporting the weight of the structure as it was being built, and it took time and a certain amount of trial and error for architects to perfect the system. The Pantheon in Rome is one of the best examples of a true dome and suggests that by 128AD, architects had mastered the form.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_agriculture_land_reclamation">Throughout the ancient world there was a drive to find new exploitable land, either through clearing forests or, more frequently, draining lakes, marshes and flooded plains. The Greeks set their sights on draining Lake Copais, a swampland north of Athens that was flooding fertile land around it as the natural flow of water was blocked due to regular earthquakes. In 325BC an engineer, Crates, sought to solve the problem by supplementing the natural drainage in the area with a long tunnel. The work was halted by the military ambitions of Alexander the Great but resumed centuries later. In 1890 the lake was finally drained and the area is now used for farming.</string>

Sacrifices in the Mesopotamian culture were often designed to offer meals to the gods, with rituals carried out several times a day in elaborate ceremonies with music, food and incense. The daily menu offered to the Sumerian god, Anu, was said to be vast and included  bulls, rams, lambs and an array of birds.</string>

It was this knowledge and the fact that their strongholds became islands when the tide was right, that allowed the Veneti to repeatedly break Roman sieges. The Romans would erect siege works and prepare to attack a stronghold; meanwhile the Veneti would be using their fleet to evacuate all their people, moving them to the safety of another coastal stronghold.  It wasn’t until Caesar insisted on the creation of a more powerful Roman fleet that the Veneti were forced to submit to Roman rule. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_civil_agriculture_improved_irrigation">In its most basic form, irrigation takes water from an available natural source and diverts it to crops through man-made channels or ponds. The Egyptians had little need for such methods thanks to the River Nile which naturally flooded their farmlands every year. The Egyptians perfected systems that diverted the flooding of the Nile to irrigate their crops and deposit the river’s nutrient-rich silt. For those less fortunate, engineering offered the opportunity to improve on primitive methods. The most effective early techniques involved the building of diversion dams that could channel water from a river or stream into a canal.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_military_war_exercises_servants_of_the_elite">The relationship between knight and squire in medieval warfare is well known, but less is known of a Celtic practice which shares a number of similarities.

The Romans developed more advanced incendiary arrows that required loosely strung custom bows to prevent the fire from being extinguished when fired. They were hugely effective against wooden hulls, siege engines and wooden siege rams. A shower of fire arrows could scatter even the most disciplined force and cause cavalry and war elephants to run amok.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_agriculture_manuring">As civilisations became more dependent on a limited area of arable land they were forced to manage soil quality carefully. In the 8th century BC, the Greeks discovered that thrush droppings, when spread across a harvested field, could enrich the soil for the next crop. The Romans, concerned about the small amount of land available around the Mediterranean, became careful masters of their farm plots, practising mixed farming. They used “fallowing”, resting the land between harvests, to allow their animal herds to naturally fertilise the soil. The Roman statesmen, Cato the Elder, listed the most effective fertilisers as “...litter from stables, lupine, chaff, beanstalks, and the leaves of oak and holm-oak.” </string>

In 331BC Alexander founded the city of Alexandria and the veneration by the Egyptians was the catalyst for his quest to achieve divine status. It had long been rumoured that he was the son of Zeus, and it was this divine parentage that led to the growth of a personality cult that helped Alexander unite and rule all his conquered lands. </string>

Stone balls of varying sizes were stored within fortifications for use when the time came. Excavations in Carthage and the Greek city of Dora provide evidence that large-scale production of ammunition took place in order to prepare for the onset of any siege. Over 5600 artillery balls have been found within the site of Carthage; they predate the Roman attack on the city that burnt it to the ground in 146BC. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_military_warrior_code_advanced_saddle">Celtic warriors were known for their ferocity and their unrivalled skill as horsemen. As one of the first Northern European peoples to develop a saddle, they were able to master the horse and improved their range of movement whilst mounted. These early saddles had four pommels, two positioned to the rear and two that angled out over each thigh. This gave the riders a firm seat and left their hands free to wield their weapon of choice.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_siege_onager">Roman siege equipment was, with the exception of some specialist pieces, always constructed on campaign.

The basic plough was known as the “ard” and was a simple soil-breaking tool pulled by animals, normally oxen. By introducing an iron ploughshare to the point of the ard, the tool became far more effective; it was able to dig deeper grooves in the soil and wore out less frequently. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_farming_crop_rotation">Planting the same crop on the same plot of land can gradually strip the soil of its nutrients, weakening the plant and inviting pests. Ancient farmers found that by carefully managing a plot these effects would subside, the soil would recover its fertility and the crop would strengthen with each passing year. Various methodologies were practiced, including two, three and even four cycles of planting, with climate dictating the complexity of rotation and the crops that could be grown. One of the most popular techniques was the “food, feed, fallow” system. This saw farmers divide fields into three sections and in each, start with a wheat crop, followed by a vegetable or cereal for livestock feed and finally, the land would be left “fallow”, or unused, to replenish its nutrients. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_civil_top_land_management">With developments in trade and transport, land could be used to reap huge profits from crops grown to meet demands for food across the known world. Land became the favoured form of investment as the big estate owners looked to manage their estates carefully to maximise production and profit. Increasing the peasant labour force was the simplest method of getting more from arable farmland, but there was also the option of investing in animal husbandry or leasing plots to tenant farmers to profit from rents.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_construction_water_sluicing">The ancients discovered that the use of water in mining, especially gold mining, eased extraction and washed ore from hillsides. Two main methods were employed, hushing and ground sluicing. Hushing used large quantities of water, stored in tanks, which were poured down over the deposit. This dislodged sediment, exposed the deposit for easier mining and washed smaller deposits into sluicing boxes where they could be collected. Ground sluicing achieved similar results but was a more controlled technique. Requiring a constant steady flow of water, it often involved the redirection of natural streams and rivers. Both techniques left land stripped back to bedrock.</string>

Defensive walls were first seen in Mesopotamia around 3000BC, when inter-city conflict increased the need for protection. Walls were seen as iconic structures directly linked to the power of the city’s god. They were often vast and complex structures. The walls of Babylon boasted a corridor-like chamber, separated by over 100 bronze gates, which ran its entire length and was wide enough to give passage to a four-horse chariot.</string>

Throughout Greece, religious buildings doubled as financial institutions, with the Parthenon in Athens at the centre of the Greek financial world. The first bankers began to emerge around the 4th Century BC when money-changers, who were normally alien residents or “metics”, set up tables in markets for loans and money exchanges. These lenders went on to become fully-fledged bankers, and state banking was gradually established as the depositing of money moved from the temples to state-run institutions.</string>

Food supplies then last longer. 

At the Battle of Alesia in 52BC the decision to expel women and children from the fortifications was made too late. Throwing out non-combatants meant more food for the fighters, but the Romans would not allow refugees through their lines. The women and children starved in the no-man’s land between the two armies. Their agonies were watched, from the safety of the walls, by their own menfolk."</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_civil_economy_formal_government">Eastern kingdoms, such as the Seleucids and Parthians, relied on a formalised structure of government to administer their territories. This was modelled on the system of the Achaemenid Empire, conquered by Alexander the Great, with Persian concepts such as satraps continuing to be used. In the case of the Seleucids, their centralised system eventually fragmented into separate kingdoms, such as Armenia and Bactria. In contrast, the decentralised government of the Parthian Empire, in which many kingdoms paid tribute to a King of Kings, fared better until its replacement by the Sassanid Empire in 224 AD.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_civil_economy_preferred_markets">Trade, in particular, transactions carried out with partners across long distances, was hugely profitable, and cities located along established trade routes were thrived.

By dictating preferred routes governments could exert some control on who gained from the prosperity that booming trade brought.

Bodies in Mesopotamia were often sealed in ceramic jars, or wrapped in matting, before being buried alongside vessels filled with blood and water, to ensure that their spirits remained well-fed.

The Roman army undoubtedly set the standard and demonstrated the gains from their disciplined tactics in numerous battles, not least when faced with war elephants at the Battle of Zama in 202BC.

The Romans had an influx of around half-a-million tonnes of food from their harvests which would eventually be dispersed around the city population but this was stored within huge warehouse complexes built at Ostia and just outside Rome. A vast network of warehouses or “horrea” were built along the embankment of the River Tiber in an area known as the Emporium district. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_management_remuneration_reforms">The military reforms of Gaius Marius marked a significant change in pay for Roman soldiers. Legionaries did not consider the new annual salary of 100 denari, complimented by payment in land or cash up to 3,000 denarii, suitable payment for 25 years hard service. Veteran troops looked to their consuls, frequently their former generals, for more suitable recompense for their efforts, causing inevitable political unrest and eventually, civil war. Emperor Augustus restored stability in the first century BC and was quick to identify the role that the dissatisfied legions had played in the years of strife. He set up the Aerarium Militare, the Military Treasury, a pot of money initiated by his own funds and topped up by regular citizen tax payments; it provided soldiers with a pension equivalent to 14 years' pay. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_tactics_pike_phalanx">Traditionally, the Greek phalanx attacked en masse in close order. Over time this tactic evolved to take on more complex forms: the Thebans adopted an oblique phalanx formation under the leadership of Epaminondas; this placed the greatest density of troops on the left wing of the phalanx to strike the enemy on their traditionally powerful right. This was used to great effect against the Spartans at the Battle of Leuctra. Epaminondas arranged his troops 50 men deep on the left to take on Sparta’s most experienced and fearsome warriors. This unexpected shift of tactics won him the battle and helped to disprove the myth that Spartan warriors were invincible.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_top_celtic_field_systems">Celtic field systems are small, square plots of land whose size and shape are often attributed to the fact that they would have been worked by one family. The term ‘Celtic field’ was coined by archaeologist O.G.S Crawford. He came across the distinctive patchwork pattern while examining photographs, taken by the Royal Air Force, of the Salisbury Plain area of Britain. Excavation of these areas revealed that they had been inhabited and worked as farmland since the Early Bronze age. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_navy_marine_training">The marines of ancient Greece were paid volunteers who tended to be from the lower citizen classes. This was possibly because they were more likely to be available for naval service because they were not liable for regular hoplite service. Fighting from the deck of a moving ship required skills that could only be developed through experience, so it is likely that the soldiers employed by Greek navies made their living as marines. Despite their low birth, marines were next to the captain in a ship's hierarchy and took part in ceremonies and political discussions. Thucydides even called the marines of one fleet “the best men” to fall in the Peloponnesian War.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_tactics_tactical_flexability">The heavy phalanx did not disappear from the Hellenistic world overnight, but there was a definite move to compliment it with more flexible and mobile fighting forces, made up of light troops and cavalry. Greek armies began to equip their troops with lighter armour and placed greater emphasis on skirmishing and one-on-one combat. They developed the “thureophoroi” infantryman, a soldier equipped with the oval thureos shield, thought to be modelled on the Roman scutum. More mobile than a hoplite, these men could protect and reinforce the phalanx, attack an enemy from the flanks and generally bridge the gap between the heavy spearman and the light peltast skirmisher. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_tactics_strategic_manoeuvres">While battles were traditionally fought on vast, open landscapes, there were exceptions and a clever strategist could use these to his advantage. Terrain was an effective form of defence, with high ground, woods and forests used to protect the rear and flanks of an army, particularly when faced with a highly mobile opponent, well provided with cavalry. Such features could also offer cover for ambush attacks, and knowledge of the terrain became a key factor in the success of the Germans and Gauls who used guerrilla tactics to counter the organised ranks of the Roman army. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_management_supply_reforms">"Of all the reforms that the later Republican Roman army introduced, the one that probably caused the most grumbling in the ranks was getting the men to carry their supplies and equipment. The semi-joking name of “Marius’ mules” given to legionaries was not a reflection on their stubbornness, but on the large amount of gear they were expected to shoulder and carry while on the march. The result was the Legions didn’t have a huge baggage train of slaves, servants and carts; the soldiers were largely their own baggage train. 

Legionaries also ate like pigs before a campaign. Fat legionaries were not unfit; they were ready for a long hard march into enemy lands, and were looked on favourably by their centurions. It was far easier to carry extra rations as body-fat inside the men. They would still eat on campaign, but they would have reserves to carry them through any days of short rations or poor foraging. This might make all the difference to victory or defeat if the enemy were clever enough to be burning everything in their path. After a few weeks of marching and conquest the legionaries would have burned through their fat and be back to fighting weight. They would also be hungry, and unforgiving to the enemy!"</string>

The basic plough was known as the “ard” and was a simple soil-breaking tool pulled by animals, normally oxen. By introducing an iron ploughshare to the point of the ard, the tool became far more effective; it was able to dig deeper grooves in the soil and wore out less frequently. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_management_professional_soldiery">Traditionally, the citizen armies of the ancient world were supplied by a combination of levies and volunteer troops. Often farmers and landowners, these men ultimately looked to return to their plots and families, comforted by the spoils of war. The professional solider was a different beast entirely. He gave his life to the army, never wavering to think on what awaited him back home. However, when a state discharged these men without suitable reward, they often turned to their generals. If successful in finding the spoils to offer his men, a general could exert huge influence and power. In 88BC Sulla was the first aggrieved general to march his men towards Rome, an act which led to many “marches on Rome” led by power hungry generals, followed by strong and powerful armies. </string>

Military service was seen as a privilege, duty and price of citizenship. Soldiers paid their own way, supplying their own weapons and equipment. In order to recruit larger, professional, full-time armies, it became sensible to pay troops and offer land on completion of military service. During the Peloponnesian War, Athens provided their troops with a living allowance which then progressed to full remuneration. Other Greek cities swiftly followed, and the military landscape began its transformation, as armies turned professional rather than being citizen militias.</string>

Fore-and-aft rigging was the solution to that problem. In this system, the sail is set parallel to the keel of the vessel, rather than at right-angles. This allows greater manoeuvrability when facing into the wind. While fore-and-aft rigging did not become widespread until many centuries later, there is ample evidence to confirm that it was employed by ancient shipwrights with the “sprit”, the triangular lateen and the quadrilateral lateen all in use. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_engineering_siege_improved_defensive_artillery">As armies strengthened their siege engines and developed artillery capable of pummelling settlement walls, defenders were forced to adapt their tactics and equipment to counter the threat. A gateway flanked by towers was no longer enough to repel a determined foe. Defensive towers and platforms grew to accommodate not only archers and slingers, but also artillery engines as well. During the siege of Lilybaeum in 274BC, the Carthaginians placed catapults along the length of their walls to fend off the armies of Pyrrhus; his men were forced to abandon the attack by the weight of the defensive artillery bombardment.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_philosophy_philosophers">The great Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato and Aristotle shaped what we define as modern-day philosophy. By questioning the firmly-held belief that the gods were responsible for everything, and suggesting more rational explanations for day-to-day events instead, the philosophers had a profound effect on society. Not surprisingly these new ideas were not welcomed by all and some philosophers were persecuted for their corrupting influence. Socrates was sentenced to death by an Athenian jury, but his work inspired Plato who went on to create a school of thought that changed governmental practices and addressed the welfare of society. </string>

Food supplies then last longer. 

At the Battle of Alesia in 52BC the decision to expel women and children from the fortifications was made too late. Throwing out non-combatants meant more food for the fighters, but the Romans would not allow refugees through their lines. The women and children starved in the no-man’s land between the two armies.

However, these were heavy and cumbersome machines, requiring large operating crews. Loading and firing took time and left the crew members vulnerable to enemy attacks, particularly from fast-moving cavalry. Placing other units nearby to guard the crew members went some way to protecting them, but arming them and improving their personal armour allowed them to protect themselves.</string>

The need to keep these archers supplied with ample ammunition was a vital logistic requirement for the armies of the east.

The most devastating blow was often delivered to the stern, although broadside impacts were more common and didn’t require as much speed to inflict damage. Skillful crews could sweep in parallel to an enemy, retracting their oars whilst shearing off those of their opponent. This would cripple an enemy ship allowing the attacker to circle and carry out a more precise ramming attack.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_engineering_construction_stone_footing">Many of the largest Celtic settlements were constructed overlooking or near to rivers. The Arevaci capital Numantia was constructed overlooking the River Douro; this 20 hectare settlement was inhabited from ancient times but reached the height of its prosperity in the third century BC. It contained both stone and timber buildings, both built on stone foundations. Little of the settlement remains to this day as the Romans systematically destroyed it and sold its occupants into slavery. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_engineering_top_engineering">To appreciate the skill of ancient engineers we need simply look at the works they left behind. The Great Pyramid at Giza, the Pantheon and the Coliseum in Rome and the Acropolis in Athens. All of these monuments were constructed in a time before heavy mechanical aids and they have stood the test of time. Some, like the Great Pyramid, have left historians slightly baffled as to how they were constructed whereas others give real insight into the civilisations that constructed them. The ceiling of the Pantheon, for example, shows Rome’s mastery of concrete and moulds to develop its complex and beautiful architecture.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_philosophy_foreign_customs">The traditions and culture of a nation can be eroded by the acceptance of foreign customs. Such a process played a significant role in the “Hellenisation” of the ancient world. Greek ideas, philosophies and customs offered exciting new possibilities for people throughout the East, the South-Eastern Mediterranean and Asia. While such customs represented progress in their eyes, traditionalists and the old could only stand back and watch while foreign influences transformed their cities and their culture. </string>

They could be raised and lowered quickly and, with a good wind, could propel a ship much faster and further than a crew of oarsmen. Yet, strong backs and oars were still favoured in battle; wind could not be relied upon and oars were perfect for positioning ships for ramming attacks and for short, sharp bursts of speed. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_tactics_spearwall">The use of spears as a defence against cavalry charges is a well-known tactic. It was still in use in the Roman army in 134AD when Arian, the governor of Cappadocia, ordered his legions to adopt an eight-rank formation which presented a formidable wall of spears against the charge of Sarmatian armoured cataphracts. While the Triarii were the only members of the pre-Marian legion equipped with thrusting spears, the heavier pilum of the Principes and the Hastati could also be used as an anti-cavalry weapon. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_navy_ramming_speed">Ancient warships were designed around a bow ram that was shoved into the hull of enemy ships to puncture and immobilise them. A ramming attack demanded an experienced and well-drilled crew, because the speed and angle of the collision were vital to the effectiveness of the attack, with some angles demanding higher speeds. However, as ships became larger, heavier and more impervious to ramming, naval warfare began to mirror the land battles of the time. Ships became mobile platforms for artillery and the hand-to-hand combat skills of the crew became the key to naval supremacy.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_tactics_weapon_proficiency">Each army had its own training methods. Nations with hoplite-heavy armies believed dancing and athletics were sufficient to prepare a man for battle. Roman generals took a slightly different view. Legionaries trained with a wooden sword, twice the weight of a battle weapon, against a wooden post. They would train for hours, practising stabs, thrusts and feints against their immobile opponent. This would then progress to fencing practice with other recruits, using swords with covered tips, before the legionary would take his honed weapon skills into full mock battles.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_druidism_sacred_grove">Celtic places of worship were almost always open to the elements. The Celts very rarely built stone temples, preferring to use natural boundaries such as trees or the banks of lakes to separate the sacred world from mundane life. Forest groves were especially hallowed spaces and were known as ‘nemeton’ or ‘sacred groves.’ Oak groves were considered to be incredibly magical, and anything that grew on a sacred oak was treated as a gift or sign from the gods. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_agriculture_improved_irrigation">In its most basic form, irrigation takes water from an available natural source and diverts it to crops through man-made channels or ponds. The Egyptians had little need for such methods thanks to the River Nile which naturally flooded their farmlands every year. The Egyptians perfected systems that diverted the flooding of the Nile to irrigate their crops and deposit the river’s nutrient-rich silt. For those less fortunate, engineering offered the opportunity to improve on primitive methods. The most effective early techniques involved the building of diversion dams that could channel water from a river or stream into a canal.</string>

Yet, when nature was unable to provide protection the Celts were capable of providing it for themselves. The tribes of Britain and Ireland constructed artificial islands known as ‘crannogs’ in rivers and lakes. They varied in complexity from mounds of peat and brush to structures with boulder foundations supporting wooden pile and beam platforms that sat just above the water level. Some even had drawbridges that provided their occupants with protection from sudden attacks. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_war_exercises_battle_fury">The Gaesatae were a group of elite Gallic warriors renowned for their ferocity. Their name roughly translates as spearman and they were mercenaries who fought against the Romans. They were infamous for going into battle completely naked, an act that the Romans wrongly attributed to a desire to be unencumbered; it was actually a way for the Gaesatae to increase their contact with the earth. Greater contact with Mother Nature ensured their rebirth into the Otherworld should they perish in the mortal one. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_navy_deck_artillary">The Hellenistic world was at the forefront of construction when it came to huge war galleys bristling with artillery. Alexander the Great used catapults from his ships when he besieged Tyre in 332BC, and it was the Greeks who built the most formidable floating fortress of the time, the Syracusia. Designed by inventor Archimedes this huge transport vessel was said to be 55 metres in length. It featured a raised fighting deck that housed a giant catapult capable of switching between firing a five metre dart or a 80 kilogramme stone missile. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_construction_tax_labour">Taxation becomes futile when a populace are too poor to pay taxes. At such times the poor were forced to work unpaid to help complete civil projects. Such measures were common practice in the ancient world; in Egypt the Pharaoh would be merciless in the taxation of his subjects. Peasants were expected to work several days a month to help maintain roads and canals and to lend their muscle to construction and mining. Some governments could be strict in the extreme when imposing tax labour: in Babylonia, failure to fulfil labour obligations would see a man forfeit his lands. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_farming_animal_husbandry">Breeding and raising livestock was a profitable activity for landowners, requiring far less labour and investment than arable farming. While animals were kept for meat, wool and dairy products for centuries and animal husbandry practised across the ancient world, it was the Romans who truly developed the art. Through selective breeding, the Romans produced bigger, stronger livestock which provided more meat, milk, cheese and wool. They also developed fish farms, to satisfy the demand for fresh fish in inland provinces. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_engineering_siege_siege_tower">Siege towers were huge feats of engineering, sometimes reaching six storeys in height. Any defenders seeing one approaching would instantly do all in their power to halt the tower's advance. Flaming arrows and boiling oil were obvious choices, which allowed the Romans to develop defensive countermeasures for towers. Wet cow skins were often fixed to the frame and men were stationed inside the tower equipped with water hoses made of pickled cow intestines to put out fires.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_navy_fore_and_aft_rigging">The square sail was prevalent throughout the ancient world but, while this made for the most efficient sailing speeds with the wind at your back, it was of little use when attempting to sail against the wind. Fore-and-aft rigging was the solution to that problem. In this system, the sail is set parallel to the keel of the vessel, rather than at right-angles. This allows greater manoeuvrability when facing into the wind. While fore-and-aft rigging did not become widespread until many centuries later, there is ample evidence to confirm that it was employed by ancient shipwrights with the “sprit”, the triangular lateen and the quadrilateral lateen all in use. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_construction_quarrying">Ambitious construction projects, particularly those of monumental proportions, required large amounts of stone. Quarrying provided the solution, with ancient engineers using the natural faultlines found in granite to split blocks from the bedrock. Once such a crack had been found, a large labour force was employed to pound the faultline, in order to weaken the rock further. These men carried sledgehammers made from rounded blocks of dolerite, a substance harder than granite. The process was accelerated further when it was discovered that rock which was heated with fires and then cooled by having water poured on, expanded and contracted. This made it split along any weaknesses such as cracks.</string>

Carthage even had a monopoly on the colour purple! Tyrian dye was one of the most highly prized commodities in the ancient world and could only be purchased from Carthage. Even the richest Roman citizens could only afford small amounts of the dye, and so purple clothing became a symbol of high status in Rome and across the world.</string>

It was this knowledge and the fact that their strongholds became islands when the tide was right, that allowed the Veneti to repeatedly break Roman sieges. The Romans would erect siege works and prepare to attack a stronghold; meanwhile the Veneti would be using their fleet to evacuate all their people, moving them to the safety of another coastal stronghold.  It wasn’t until Caesar insisted on the creation of a more powerful Roman fleet that the Veneti were forced to submit to Roman rule. </string>

These servants remained behind the ranks until their charge needed a new mount, was injured or killed. If the warrior took a wound one of the riders would take him back to camp while the other took his place in battle. </string>

At the bottom were the farmers and labourers, above them the warriors and at the top of society, the intellectuals. Members of the warrior and intellectual castes were buried in lavish graves with all the items they would need in the Otherworld. It is thanks to this custom that we have been able to learn more about these ancient societies. For example, many of the beautiful weapons found in the graves of warriors were simply a symbol of their position in society rather than a practical weapon. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_construction_border_forts">Built on Egypt’s eastern border, the fortress of Tharo was a testament to the power of the pharaohs. The first in a line of 11 forts that ran along a route known as The Horus Way, its walls were thought to be 1,640 feet long and 820 feet wide. Lined with towers and surrounded by a tributary of the Nile to the east and a moat to the north, which some historians argue may have been filled with crocodiles, the walls of Tharo were near impenetrable. It is hardly surprising that it survived periods of Roman and Greek rule to stand for over a thousand years.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_civil_economy_archive">As trade and commerce improved, education and research blossomed and so documentation rapidly increased. Archiving records and documents became crucial to maintaining legal institutions and promoting further learning. The first libraries and archives were set up locally, collecting the information pertinent to the surrounding area. The most significant universal archive of information in the ancient world was the Library of Alexandria, which was said to have housed over half a million documents and scrolls. With its vast store of knowledge, it became the centre of education and is recognised as one of the birthplaces of science. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_philosophy_natural_philosophy">In the ancient world the gods controlled, and thus were responsible for, everything that happened. This worldview went unquestioned until Thales of Miletus started searching for rational rather than supernatural explanations for the way the world worked. His thinking was followed up by a stream of great thinkers who speculated that the world was governed by a single substance. This school of thought then expanded to suggest that, aside from the known earth, water, wind and fire, there were many elements at play that made up the world and, by the early fifth century BC, the concept of tiny particles called atoms was first presented. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_military_top_foraging">When fighting in foreign lands an army lives or dies on its foraging abilities. The ancient Celts were well aware of this fact and made it incredibly difficult for the Romans to gather food during their invasion.

What they neglect to mention is the Celtic tradition of deciding battles through single combat. A brave champion would step from the ranks and present his challenge, boasting of his great deeds and those of his ancestors before him. Once the two champions had done battle the victor would win the war for his tribe and they would return home. However, the Romans did not hold to these traditions and even if a Celtic champion beat a Roman in single combat they would fall on the unsuspecting Celts and exact revenge for their fallen comrade.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_navy_epic_naval_architecture">All warships in the ancient world were limited in size by a number of practical considerations. This meant most warships were triremes or “threes”, or perhaps quinquiremes or “fives”, usually named for the number of banks of oars or the number of rowers. Being propelled by oars brought limits: there were only so many rowers that could operate a single oar; there was a practical limit to the stroke and angle of an oar; and so forth. There was also a limit to how long and slender a galley could be before it would flex too much in any kind of sea and tear itself to pieces, but too broad a beam would make it a lumbering target. None of these constraints mattered a jot to some nations, who built increasingly large vessels, culminating in a few “30s” and even a couple of “40s”. These gargantuan vessels must have been catamarans with fighting platforms linking the hulls, but they were all little more than vanity projects for the kings and pharaohs who ordered them built.</string>

Bodies in Mesopotamia were often sealed in ceramic jars, or wrapped in matting, before being buried alongside vessels filled with blood and water, to ensure that their spirits remained well-fed. There is evidence to suggest that such vessels were broken during the ceremony and also that torches were lit around the grave to protect the living from the contamination of the dead.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_navy_fore_and_aft_rigging">The square sail was prevalent throughout the ancient world but, while this made for the most efficient sailing speeds with the wind at your back, it was of little use when attempting to sail against the wind. Fore-and-aft rigging was the solution to that problem. In this system, the sail is set parallel to the keel of the vessel, rather than at right-angles. This allows greater manoeuvrability when facing into the wind. While fore-and-aft rigging did not become widespread until many centuries later, there is ample evidence to confirm that it was employed by ancient shipwrights with the “sprit”, the triangular lateen and the quadrilateral lateen all in use. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_economy_state_banking">The first form of banking was carried out by priests, with temples housing deposits and authenticating coinage, exchanging gold and dealing with loans. Throughout Greece, religious buildings doubled as financial institutions, with the Parthenon in Athens at the centre of the Greek financial world. The first bankers began to emerge around the 4th Century BC when money-changers, who were normally alien residents or “metics”, set up tables in markets for loans and money exchanges. These lenders went on to become fully-fledged bankers, and state banking was gradually established as the depositing of money moved from the temples to state-run institutions.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_engineering_siege_armoured_siege_engineers">Large torsion-powered catapults and siege engines were powerful weapons that could devastate densely packed enemies in open battle, or topple walls during sieges. However, these were heavy and cumbersome machines, requiring large operating crews. Loading and firing took time and left the crew members vulnerable to enemy attacks, particularly from fast-moving cavalry. Placing other units nearby to guard the crew members went some way to protecting them, but arming them and improving their personal armour allowed them to protect themselves.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_engineering_construction_quarrying">Ambitious construction projects, particularly those of monumental proportions, required large amounts of stone. Quarrying provided the solution, with ancient engineers using the natural faultlines found in granite to split blocks from the bedrock. Once such a crack had been found, a large labour force was employed to pound the faultline, in order to weaken the rock further. These men carried sledgehammers made from rounded blocks of dolerite, a substance harder than granite. The process was accelerated further when it was discovered that rock which was heated with fires and then cooled by having water poured on, expanded and contracted. This made it split along any weaknesses such as cracks.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_management_land_laws">Land was profitable for those who could afford to work it effectively, and this helped make it difficult for the poor to obtain land. By introducing land laws, the Romans sought to redistribute the land they had acquired through their military expansion. They attempted to limit the control of wealthy landowners on several occasions, but often faced obstruction and blatant flouting of the legislation by the privileged few. The most significant redistribution of Roman land came in the first century BC when land, mainly in Italy, was confiscated and shared amongst thousands of military veterans as payment for their years of service. </string>

Wrestling was a popular pursuit, as was pankration, a particularly brutal form of boxing. Proceedings within the gymnasia were overseen by the gymnasiarch.

In 44BC, Augustus and his friend Agrippa, both young men at the time, consulted the Greek astrologer Theogenes. He prophesied great things for the pair who went on to become Rome’s first Emperor and one of her most revered politicians and generals.

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_siege_central_grain_warehouse">As populations grew and the demand for food increased, long-term storage of grain became vital. With improved transport allowing for the movement of grain, it became possible to construct vast storage warehouses to hold a shipped-in food stock. The Romans had an influx of around half-a-million tonnes of food from their harvests which would eventually be dispersed around the city population but this was stored within huge warehouse complexes built at Ostia and just outside Rome. A vast network of warehouses or “horrea” were built along the embankment of the River Tiber in an area known as the Emporium district. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_military_navy_leather_sails">Conditions in the Atlantic Ocean could be difficult, with squalls and violent storms to navigate. Any vessel hoping to survive regular voyages in these rough conditions needed to be strong and sturdy. The Celts used oak in their ship construction, which meant the hulls could withstand the battering of the waves and Roman ships, but it also meant they needed a sturdier sail. They favoured leather, as this hard wearing material could cope with the rough conditions and the sheer weight of the ships. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_management_training_reforms">"With the Marius reforms joining the Roman army became a full-time occupation. Men trained all year round, not just during the campaign season when Rome was under threat. 

Legionaries were expected to be able to fight in a number of formations with a variety of weapons. These skills were then tested in mock training battles. The captured Jewish leader, Josephus, witnessed such drills and offered a vivid account of the violence that took place “...it would be fair enough to call their drills bloodless battles and their battles bloody drills”."</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_tribal_council_mint">Examples of Celtic coins have been found in Britain dating back to the second century BC. The Celts tended to mint their coins by casting gold, silver or bronze into moulds of burnt clay; each coin was then hammered between two stamps to give it its distinctive design. Just like any other rulers, Celtic leaders had coins minted with their names and faces on. Examples of these have been discovered, including coins minted for Cunobelinus, leader of the Britons and the mighty Gaul Vercingetorix. </string>

Contracts did exist prior to this point but consensual contracts allowed transactions to take place without property changing hands: there merely needed to be consensus or agreement between the involved parties. There were four types of consensual contract: “emptio-venditio” was a contract for the exchange of goods; “locatio-conductio” was a contract for the hire of goods; while “societas” governed partnerships. The final consensual contract was “mandatum” which dealt with the commissioning of one party to carry out an activity that would benefit another without reward. </string>

Early Phoenician ships had pointed rams that were sheathed in bronze and positioned under the waterline. This type of ram often saw the attacker impaled in its victim and unable to break free. By the fourth century, the ram evolved to feature multiple blades above and below the waterline. The Greeks developed a blunt bronze ram which was designed to smash the enemy hull rather than pierce it, enabling them to attack, break free and watch their stricken foes sink. </string>

While animals were kept for meat, wool and dairy products for centuries and animal husbandry practised across the ancient world, it was the Romans who truly developed the art. Through selective breeding, the Romans produced bigger, stronger livestock which provided more meat, milk, cheese and wool. They also developed fish farms, to satisfy the demand for fresh fish in inland provinces. </string>

Nations with hoplite-heavy armies believed dancing and athletics were sufficient to prepare a man for battle. Roman generals took a slightly different view. Legionaries trained with a wooden sword, twice the weight of a battle weapon, against a wooden post. They would train for hours, practising stabs, thrusts and feints against their immobile opponent. This would then progress to fencing practice with other recruits, using swords with covered tips, before the legionary would take his honed weapon skills into full mock battles.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_engineering_construction_tax_labour">Taxation becomes futile when a populace are too poor to pay taxes. At such times the poor were forced to work unpaid to help complete civil projects. Such measures were common practice in the ancient world; in Egypt the Pharaoh would be merciless in the taxation of his subjects. Peasants were expected to work several days a month to help maintain roads and canals and to lend their muscle to construction and mining. Some governments could be strict in the extreme when imposing tax labour: in Babylonia, failure to fulfil labour obligations would see a man forfeit his lands. </string>

Farmers soon realised that irrigation systems, like canals and dams, were ideal for storing and transporting the water they needed for “dry-farming” in these areas. In Mesopotamia, the Euphrates and Tigris rivers were unpredictable and could often swell after sowing season, flooding the crops. Storage basins were therefore used to collect the surplus water, and a canal system was constructed to distribute it as needed to the fields.</string>

The semi-joking name of “Marius’ mules” given to legionaries was not a reflection on their stubbornness, but on the large amount of gear they were expected to shoulder and carry while on the march. The result was the Legions didn’t have a huge baggage train of slaves, servants and carts; the soldiers were largely their own baggage train. 

Legionaries also ate like pigs before a campaign. Fat legionaries were not unfit; they were ready for a long hard march into enemy lands, and were looked on favourably by their centurions. It was far easier to carry extra rations as body-fat inside the men. They would still eat on campaign, but they would have reserves to carry them through any days of short rations or poor foraging. This might make all the difference to victory or defeat if the enemy were clever enough to be burning everything in their path. After a few weeks of marching and conquest the legionaries would have burned through their fat and be back to fighting weight. They would also be hungry, and unforgiving to the enemy!"</string>

Their ideas were then accepted by the Greeks who were responsible for a number of key advances in astronomy, the most impressive of which so far discovered was the Antikythera mechanism. Found in a shipwreck, this device was an early analogue computer used to track the movement of the planets. Until its discovery in 1900 it was believed the first device of this kind hadn’t been invented until the 14th century.</string>

Land in Greece itself was a precious resource, and advancing agricultural techniques along with a growing network of trade allowed landowners to make their plots profitable through farming and animal husbandry. Like so many Greek institutions, the auction of land became common in other territories as a means for governments to profit from their land, particularly disused and derelict plots. </string>

The Egyptians had little need for such methods thanks to the River Nile which naturally flooded their farmlands every year. The Egyptians perfected systems that diverted the flooding of the Nile to irrigate their crops and deposit the river’s nutrient-rich silt. For those less fortunate, engineering offered the opportunity to improve on primitive methods. The most effective early techniques involved the building of diversion dams that could channel water from a river or stream into a canal.</string>

The Corlea bog in Ireland is home to one of the best preserved Celtic timber track ways; the tree-rings on the wood point to a tree-felling date of 148 BC, long before the Romans arrived and began building their stone roads.

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_engineering_siege_great_food_vault">Storing large amounts of food became incredibly important as the Romans invaded. Sieges could last for months and starving a population out of their home was a popular Roman tactic. It was employed by Caesar at the Siege of Alesia in 52BC, the battle that ultimately won him the war in Gaul. Conditions became so dire in Alesia that Vercingetorix was forced to eject all the women and children from the city, hoping to save food for the warriors and trusting that the Romans would allow the civilians to flee to safety. However, Caesar issued orders that no exits were to be made in the siege works and the women and children starved to death between the walls of their home and the Roman siege works. </string>

All of these monuments were constructed in a time before heavy mechanical aids and they have stood the test of time. Some, like the Great Pyramid, have left historians slightly baffled as to how they were constructed whereas others give real insight into the civilisations that constructed them.

Such features could also offer cover for ambush attacks, and knowledge of the terrain became a key factor in the success of the Germans and Gauls who used guerrilla tactics to counter the organised ranks of the Roman army. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_civil_druidism_sacred_grove">Celtic places of worship were almost always open to the elements. The Celts very rarely built stone temples, preferring to use natural boundaries such as trees or the banks of lakes to separate the sacred world from mundane life. Forest groves were especially hallowed spaces and were known as ‘nemeton’ or ‘sacred groves.’ Oak groves were considered to be incredibly magical, and anything that grew on a sacred oak was treated as a gift or sign from the gods. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_tactics_advanced_cavalry_tactics">The horsemen of Parthia, Armenia and Sarmatia were some of the finest in the ancient world. Their complex formations and tactics were so effective that other armies, including the Romans, rushed to copy them. The Cantabrian Circle, a fast-moving cavalry formation, was adopted by the Roman army shortly after the Cantabrian Wars. Riders would form a loose circle, each horse following the next at full gallop and as the riders came round to face the enemy they would loose their arrows. This deadly formation presented a difficult target for enemy archers and provided a constant stream of deadly arrow fire. </string>

His thinking was followed up by a stream of great thinkers who speculated that the world was governed by a single substance. This school of thought then expanded to suggest that, aside from the known earth, water, wind and fire, there were many elements at play that made up the world and, by the early fifth century BC, the concept of tiny particles called atoms was first presented. </string>

Taking enemy heads was not, as the Romans believed, a barbaric act perpetrated by blood-crazed madmen but a sign of respect. Enemy heads were washed, embalmed in cedar oil and placed on display to show a warrior’s prowess in battle. They were even used as votive offerings. Many embalmed heads have been discovered in rivers known to be sacred to the ancient Celts. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_tribal_council_multilingual">Although barbarian tribes had their own languages they often used the alphabets of other civilisations for their written records. Early Celtic text, found on a variety of artefacts, used the Etruscan alphabet, however, around the third century BC the use of Greek characters became more prevalent, especially in Gaul. Potters records, graffiti and the Coligny calendar have all been found in areas inhabited by the tribes of Gaul and were all written using the Greek alphabet. </string>

At such times the poor were forced to work unpaid to help complete civil projects. Such measures were common practice in the ancient world; in Egypt the Pharaoh would be merciless in the taxation of his subjects. Peasants were expected to work several days a month to help maintain roads and canals and to lend their muscle to construction and mining. Some governments could be strict in the extreme when imposing tax labour: in Babylonia, failure to fulfil labour obligations would see a man forfeit his lands. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_philosophy_mysticism">The idea of the “Imperial Cult”, for the worship of Rome in the form of a Roman Emperor, started when Julius Caesar was officially given divine status by the Senate. His adopted son, Augustus, then went on to give himself the title of “Pontifex Maximus”, chief priest of the Roman state, and encouraged the construction of temples in his name. The reverence of a living Emperor was not practised in Rome itself, but throughout the rest of the Empire citizens had an obligation not only to serve the Emperor but also to swear allegiance to him as a figure of worship. This allowed Rome to unify their distant provinces and spread Roman culture.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_military_warrior_code_war_horn">War horns were designed to intimidate the enemy and came in many shapes and sizes, but perhaps the most interesting was the Celtic carnyx. As long as a man is tall, the bell of the horn often depicted an animal head; examples of snake, horse and boar heads have been found across Europe. The carnyx produced a long drawn out scream and some historians believe that the Celts deliberately sabotaged them to stop outsiders from playing them. A number of carnyx discovered in France in 2004 were missing a key component in the bell of the horn which prevented them from making their infamous scream.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_engineering_construction_moulded_architecture">By perfecting concrete, a plentiful and cheap building material, the Romans were able to build structures quickly and without the need for vast teams of skilled craftsmen. Timber frames, or moulds, were used to provide a framework for the concrete walls; constructing them was a task that could be done by a relatively unskilled labourer. The frameworks could also be re-used, making the whole process relatively cheap, quick and efficient. This could prove vital in times of war when defensive structures needed to be built quickly.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_management_land_laws">Land was profitable for those who could afford to work it effectively, and this helped make it difficult for the poor to obtain land. By introducing land laws, the Romans sought to redistribute the land they had acquired through their military expansion. They attempted to limit the control of wealthy landowners on several occasions, but often faced obstruction and blatant flouting of the legislation by the privileged few. The most significant redistribution of Roman land came in the first century BC when land, mainly in Italy, was confiscated and shared amongst thousands of military veterans as payment for their years of service. </string>

It was only a short time until bigger and better designs appeared, usually involving decorating the ram with a ram's head. The Macedonians made many advances in siege craft, including the introduction of the covered battering-ram, the cunning invention of Polyidus of Thessaly who served Philip II of Macedon.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_druidism_stargazing">Druids were thought to have knowledge of the Otherworld, they read the signs sent by the gods and interpreted their meaning for the tribe. This included reading the plant life that grew on the sacred oak tree and interpreting the movements of the stars and planets. As druidic doctrine was passed along verbally we may never have known the extent of their knowledge and understanding of astronomy if it had not been for Caesar who wrote that, “They also hold long discussions about the heavenly bodies and their movements, the size of the universe and of the earth, the physical constitutions of the world and the powers and properties of the gods.”</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_engineering_siege_armoured_siege_engineers">Large torsion-powered catapults and siege engines were powerful weapons that could devastate densely packed enemies in open battle, or topple walls during sieges. However, these were heavy and cumbersome machines, requiring large operating crews. Loading and firing took time and left the crew members vulnerable to enemy attacks, particularly from fast-moving cavalry. Placing other units nearby to guard the crew members went some way to protecting them, but arming them and improving their personal armour allowed them to protect themselves.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_economy_consensual_contracts">Consensual contracts were introduced by the Romans and proved pivotal in their growth and prosperity as a trading nation. Contracts did exist prior to this point but consensual contracts allowed transactions to take place without property changing hands: there merely needed to be consensus or agreement between the involved parties. There were four types of consensual contract: “emptio-venditio” was a contract for the exchange of goods; “locatio-conductio” was a contract for the hire of goods; while “societas” governed partnerships. The final consensual contract was “mandatum” which dealt with the commissioning of one party to carry out an activity that would benefit another without reward. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_economy_public_auction">The auction was an institution in the Hellenistic world, with Greek states using them as an effective method of redistributing land and gathering extra funds. Land in Greece itself was a precious resource, and advancing agricultural techniques along with a growing network of trade allowed landowners to make their plots profitable through farming and animal husbandry. Like so many Greek institutions, the auction of land became common in other territories as a means for governments to profit from their land, particularly disused and derelict plots. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_engineering_construction_double_wall_construction">The Vindelici tribe constructed their settlement known as Manching close to the Danube River. This walled city enclosed some 380 hectares, it comprised carefully laid out streets and impressive outer walls. These were built of a box structure of criss-cross timbers laid horizontally, the stone walls were then built on either side of the timbers and the centre was filled with rubble and stones, creating very thick, strong walls. When Caesar came across this particular construction technique he called it Murus Gallici, or Gallic Walls.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_war_exercises_ambushing_techniques">The Battle of Teutoburg Forest is perhaps the greatest example of barbarian ambush tactics. Forcing the Roman army to take a track which led between a bog to the north and woodland to the south, the Germanic tribes constructed earthen walls that allowed them to fire down on the Romans from cover. After failing to storm the walls the Roman cavalry fled, leaving the remaining troops to the mercy of the tribesmen who were now swarming over the walls. This carefully planned attack convinced the Romans that the Germanic tribes were a force to be reckoned with and they gave up their dreams of conquering the lands north of the Rhine. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_philosophy_physicians">Rome and Greece produced some of the finest physicians in the ancient world, most notably Galen, who first learnt his trade treating gladiators and later became personal physician to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. He was responsible for a number of published works on human anatomy, as well as the concept of taking an individual’s pulse and the practice of bloodletting. Galen followed the principles of the great Greek physician Hippocrates, in that he believed the human condition was based on the balance of four “humours”: yellow bile, black bile, phlegm and blood. It was thought that illness was caused by an excess or deficiency in any one of these humours, a theory that went unquestioned until the sixteenth century.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_engineering_siege_boiling_oil">"The passive protection of walls was never enough to keep out attackers. Defenders began experimenting with other ways to repel invading enemy forces, and one such method was the use of boiling oil. The Roman army encountered it at the siege of Jotapata. The historian Josephus described the effect the oil had on the Roman soldiers, ""the oil did easily run down the whole body from head to foot, under their armour, and fed upon their flesh like flame itself."""</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_engineering_siege_ammunition_stores">Artillery provided defenders with greater firepower, but created a need to produce and store large amounts of ammunition. Stone balls of varying sizes were stored within fortifications for use when the time came. Excavations in Carthage and the Greek city of Dora provide evidence that large-scale production of ammunition took place in order to prepare for the onset of any siege. Over 5600 artillery balls have been found within the site of Carthage; they predate the Roman attack on the city that burnt it to the ground in 146BC. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_navy_leather_sails">Conditions in the Atlantic Ocean could be difficult, with squalls and violent storms to navigate. Any vessel hoping to survive regular voyages in these rough conditions needed to be strong and sturdy. The Celts used oak in their ship construction, which meant the hulls could withstand the battering of the waves and Roman ships, but it also meant they needed a sturdier sail. They favoured leather, as this hard wearing material could cope with the rough conditions and the sheer weight of the ships. </string>

While animals were kept for meat, wool and dairy products for centuries and animal husbandry practised across the ancient world, it was the Romans who truly developed the art. Through selective breeding, the Romans produced bigger, stronger livestock which provided more meat, milk, cheese and wool. They also developed fish farms, to satisfy the demand for fresh fish in inland provinces. </string>

Through the study of these artefacts and their distinctive patterns, archaeologists have been able to piece together the emergence and expansion of Celtic production. As their contact with Rome and other Mediterranean powers increased so too did their output of tradable commodities. Trade with the Greeks is thought to have inspired the creation of a Celtic coinage system, a system that was in place for 50 years before the Romans started minting their own coins.</string>

The origins of astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia with the Sumerians, whose knowledge passed to and was developed by the Babylonians. Their ideas were then accepted by the Greeks who were responsible for a number of key advances in astronomy, the most impressive of which so far discovered was the Antikythera mechanism. Found in a shipwreck, this device was an early analogue computer used to track the movement of the planets. Until its discovery in 1900 it was believed the first device of this kind hadn’t been invented until the 14th century.</string>

The inhabitants of the British coast believed that a series of small islands in the Bristol Channel were Otherworld realms. The magic of these islands can be explained, in part, by the sea mists that still obscure them from time to time, making them completely disappear. </string>

Nations with hoplite-heavy armies believed dancing and athletics were sufficient to prepare a man for battle. Roman generals took a slightly different view. Legionaries trained with a wooden sword, twice the weight of a battle weapon, against a wooden post. They would train for hours, practising stabs, thrusts and feints against their immobile opponent. This would then progress to fencing practice with other recruits, using swords with covered tips, before the legionary would take his honed weapon skills into full mock battles.</string>

Invented by the Romans, the corvus enabled them to compete with enemies who boasted superior mastery of the seas and, most notably, the Carthaginians. It was first used in the Battle of Mylae in 260BC, when the over-confident Carthaginians sailed towards their enemy, only to have the first 30 ships captured by the Romans. The rest of the Carthaginian fleet soon took flight but not before 50 ships were lost thanks to Roman engineering ingenuity.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_druidism_sacred_grove">Celtic places of worship were almost always open to the elements. The Celts very rarely built stone temples, preferring to use natural boundaries such as trees or the banks of lakes to separate the sacred world from mundane life. Forest groves were especially hallowed spaces and were known as ‘nemeton’ or ‘sacred groves.’ Oak groves were considered to be incredibly magical, and anything that grew on a sacred oak was treated as a gift or sign from the gods. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_management_supply_reforms">"Of all the reforms that the later Republican Roman army introduced, the one that probably caused the most grumbling in the ranks was getting the men to carry their supplies and equipment. The semi-joking name of “Marius’ mules” given to legionaries was not a reflection on their stubbornness, but on the large amount of gear they were expected to shoulder and carry while on the march. The result was the Legions didn’t have a huge baggage train of slaves, servants and carts; the soldiers were largely their own baggage train. 

Legionaries also ate like pigs before a campaign. Fat legionaries were not unfit; they were ready for a long hard march into enemy lands, and were looked on favourably by their centurions. It was far easier to carry extra rations as body-fat inside the men. They would still eat on campaign, but they would have reserves to carry them through any days of short rations or poor foraging. This might make all the difference to victory or defeat if the enemy were clever enough to be burning everything in their path. After a few weeks of marching and conquest the legionaries would have burned through their fat and be back to fighting weight. They would also be hungry, and unforgiving to the enemy!"</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_engineering_siege_helepolis">Invented by the Greek engineer Polyidus of Thessaly, the Helepolis or “city taker” was the biggest siege engine ever constructed. King Demetrius I of Macedon commissioned the architect Epimachus of Athens to build the biggest recorded Helepolis, which he used in the failed siege of Rhodes in 305BC. This huge construction was said to be nearly 40m tall, split into nine storeys, with catapults at its base and two stairways giving access to its multiple levels. Built entirely of wood, it was covered with iron plates to protect it from fire. During the siege the Rhodians managed to dislodge some of these plates, prompting Demetrius to withdraw the weapon for fear of its destruction.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_agriculture_intensified_agriculture">As populations boomed the demand for food increased, driving farmers to use more intensive farming techniques. Technology played its part, with improved tools and the domestication of large animals to pull advanced and effective ploughs. Larger labour forces and the growth of other techniques, such as terraced farming, opened new areas for cultivation. The construction of more complex canals and dams helped to turn arid landscapes into well-irrigated farming plots. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_management_training_reforms">"With the Marius reforms joining the Roman army became a full-time occupation. Men trained all year round, not just during the campaign season when Rome was under threat. 

Legionaries were expected to be able to fight in a number of formations with a variety of weapons. These skills were then tested in mock training battles. The captured Jewish leader, Josephus, witnessed such drills and offered a vivid account of the violence that took place “...it would be fair enough to call their drills bloodless battles and their battles bloody drills”."</string>
<string name="technologies_onscreen_name_rom_briton_military_warrior_code_focused_flanking">Focused Flanking</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_engineering_construction_raised_site">The ancient Celts tended to build their forts and cities in areas that offered natural protection. Yet, when nature was unable to provide protection the Celts were capable of providing it for themselves. The tribes of Britain and Ireland constructed artificial islands known as ‘crannogs’ in rivers and lakes. They varied in complexity from mounds of peat and brush to structures with boulder foundations supporting wooden pile and beam platforms that sat just above the water level. Some even had drawbridges that provided their occupants with protection from sudden attacks. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_construction_concrete">Derived from the Latin term “concretus”, meaning “grow together”, the development of concrete transformed Roman construction methods. The addition of Pozzolana, a sandy black volcanic ash named after an area around the Bay of Naples, created a stronger paste which allowed for construction underwater, something crucial for bridge building. Concrete also allowed the construction of elaborate architectural features, such as curved columns and arches, the most notable examples of these being in the Pantheon in Rome. </string>

The Great Pyramid at Giza, the Pantheon and the Coliseum in Rome and the Acropolis in Athens. All of these monuments were constructed in a time before heavy mechanical aids and they have stood the test of time. Some, like the Great Pyramid, have left historians slightly baffled as to how they were constructed whereas others give real insight into the civilisations that constructed them. The ceiling of the Pantheon, for example, shows Rome’s mastery of concrete and moulds to develop its complex and beautiful architecture.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_military_navy_advanced_crew_training">The Veneti tribe had the most impressive fleets of all of the tribes of Gaul, crewed by men who knew their ships and the coastline. It was this knowledge and the fact that their strongholds became islands when the tide was right, that allowed the Veneti to repeatedly break Roman sieges. The Romans would erect siege works and prepare to attack a stronghold; meanwhile the Veneti would be using their fleet to evacuate all their people, moving them to the safety of another coastal stronghold.  It wasn’t until Caesar insisted on the creation of a more powerful Roman fleet that the Veneti were forced to submit to Roman rule. </string>

Mercenaries became a great way to bolster troop numbers during times of war, something the Carthaginians resorted to during their war with Rome. They exploited their trade links to recruit troops from the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic islands. The Romans were more sparing with their use of mercenaries, but acknowledged the shortcomings within the legion, notably archers and cavalry, by making up for the lack with carefully chosen mercenary troops. </string>

Chysauster is one of the best preserved early Celtic stone villages; it was constructed before the Roman invasion of Britain and continued to be inhabited until the 4th century AD. Out of the nine oval houses found in the village only one had under floor drainage, which may indicate that it was a symbol of prestige. </string>

Governmental positions and titles were opened up to those outside of the royal family as the arrival of documentation and bureaucracy led to the formation of local government. A system of mayors and town councils were given jurisdiction over communities, and this proved crucial in administering the annual survey which provided a huge boost to Egypt’s economy.</string>

Caesar described how the Veneti had the largest fleet of the Gallic tribes and were masters of navigating the western seas. He also stated that their ships were “made with flatter bottoms, to help them to ride shallow waters caused by shoals or ebb tides.” These shallow keels were perfect for navigating the rocky coastlines, an attribute that Roman ships lacked. </string>

Stone balls of varying sizes were stored within fortifications for use when the time came. Excavations in Carthage and the Greek city of Dora provide evidence that large-scale production of ammunition took place in order to prepare for the onset of any siege. Over 5600 artillery balls have been found within the site of Carthage; they predate the Roman attack on the city that burnt it to the ground in 146BC. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_economy_mint">Carthage relied heavily on mercenaries to bolster its citizen armies, a strategy that worked well for short campaigns close to home. However, when campaigns lasted longer than anticipated and coin was not forthcoming, mercenaries became less than trustworthy. In 240BC a group of mercenaries who had fought for Carthage during the First Punic War seized Tunis because they weren't paid. To help prevent this situation from ever arising again the Carthaginians began minting coins on campaign. They were made from silver, gold and electrum and were marked “from the camp”.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_construction_advanced_construction_techniques">As building materials became more understood and skills developed amongst architects and builders, new construction techniques became possible. Domes, arches and vaults became regular features in Roman architecture but a true dome was perhaps the pinnacle achievement of architects and builders of the time. They posed complex puzzles when it came to supporting the weight of the structure as it was being built, and it took time and a certain amount of trial and error for architects to perfect the system. The Pantheon in Rome is one of the best examples of a true dome and suggests that by 128AD, architects had mastered the form.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_management_manipular_organisation">The Roman legion was established in 320 BC, splitting Rome’s forces into three distinct classes based on age, experience and wealth. The legion was formed up as thirty compact blocks of men or “maniples”, deployed in a “chessboard” formation. The “hastati”, made up of the youngest men, were the first to engage the enemy. Armed with “pila” or javelins, they were backed by a second row of “principes”, men in the prime of their life who were formidable enough to close any battle for the Romans. They too were armed with pila as well as a sword for close combat. Behind this rank of men, the “triarii” would wait. Often kept kneeling to help check any temptation to charge into the fray, these men were the most experienced troops in the legion.</string>

Fore-and-aft rigging was the solution to that problem. In this system, the sail is set parallel to the keel of the vessel, rather than at right-angles. This allows greater manoeuvrability when facing into the wind. While fore-and-aft rigging did not become widespread until many centuries later, there is ample evidence to confirm that it was employed by ancient shipwrights with the “sprit”, the triangular lateen and the quadrilateral lateen all in use. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_civil_tribal_council_craft_specialisation">The skill of Celtic craftsmen is well known thanks to artefacts that have been discovered during excavations. Through the study of these artefacts and their distinctive patterns, archaeologists have been able to piece together the emergence and expansion of Celtic production. As their contact with Rome and other Mediterranean powers increased so too did their output of tradable commodities. Trade with the Greeks is thought to have inspired the creation of a Celtic coinage system, a system that was in place for 50 years before the Romans started minting their own coins.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_civil_farming_crop_rotation">Planting the same crop on the same plot of land can gradually strip the soil of its nutrients, weakening the plant and inviting pests. Ancient farmers found that by carefully managing a plot these effects would subside, the soil would recover its fertility and the crop would strengthen with each passing year. Various methodologies were practiced, including two, three and even four cycles of planting, with climate dictating the complexity of rotation and the crops that could be grown. One of the most popular techniques was the “food, feed, fallow” system. This saw farmers divide fields into three sections and in each, start with a wheat crop, followed by a vegetable or cereal for livestock feed and finally, the land would be left “fallow”, or unused, to replenish its nutrients. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_philosophy_astronomy">The study of the night sky is probably older than civilization, for the gods lived in the skies. The origins of astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia with the Sumerians, whose knowledge passed to and was developed by the Babylonians. Their ideas were then accepted by the Greeks who were responsible for a number of key advances in astronomy, the most impressive of which so far discovered was the Antikythera mechanism. Found in a shipwreck, this device was an early analogue computer used to track the movement of the planets. Until its discovery in 1900 it was believed the first device of this kind hadn’t been invented until the 14th century.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_management_organised_supply">With armies of increasing size, and campaigns taking troops overseas for months and years, it became vital to maintain supply-lines to keep them provisioned. However, an army’s movement could be severely hampered by its supply train and it was the Greeks who revolutionised military supply and logistics. They disbanded the legion of attendants and wives that trailed behind every army, and introduced the speedier horse and mule to replace the ox-drawn carts. They also made the soldiers carry more. The creation of standardised coinage also allowed states to provide for their armies in enemy territory, because their money could be trusted, with some merchants evolving into the first military contractors. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_agriculture_terraced_fields">With an ongoing struggle to collect and harness water supplies to irrigate their fields in arid climates, eastern civilisations turned to terracing in order to utilise land on hills and mountainsides. Narrow fields, formed as steps in the sloping land, allowed hillsides to be farmed with little risk of soil erosion. Each step, or field, was irrigated by a network of canals. In Mesopotamia, terraced fields were irrigated by a network of “shadufs” which were placed on each step. This simple ancient water-lifting device was made up of a large beam, supporting a rope and bucket, with a counter weight at the opposite end.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_agriculture_improved_drainage">After the destruction of Carthage much of its literature was destroyed by the Romans, with the exception of the works of one man.

These were built of a box structure of criss-cross timbers laid horizontally, the stone walls were then built on either side of the timbers and the centre was filled with rubble and stones, creating very thick, strong walls. When Caesar came across this particular construction technique he called it Murus Gallici, or Gallic Walls.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_civil_tribal_council_land_and_community_laws">Ancient Celtic society was built on agriculture and many of its laws dealt with this important aspect of life. Clearly identifying the boundaries between farmland was paramount and so boundary pillar stones were erected. In Ireland Cormac mac Cuileannanin’s ‘Sanas Chormaic’ gave them the name ‘gallan,’ as they were first erected by the Gauls when they arrived in Ireland. This type of stone has also been found in England and Scotland and they often have names engraved on them in ‘Ogham.’</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_engineering_construction_enclosed_settlement">The Aedui built an impressive settlement known as Bibracte near Burgundy in France; its walls were thought to be five kilometres in circumference and five metres high.

Archaeologists have been able to study this site extensively owing to the fact that the initially pro-Roman Aedui avoided the treatment of the many tribes who fought against the Roman occupation of Gaul.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_economy_fixed_tarrifs">As international trade boomed, so central government increased their intervention in trading matters, having previously allowed merchants much autonomy.

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_economy_armed_escorts">Trade between cities promised huge profits.

Powerful and wealthy individuals exploited such situations, with “caravan-chiefs” selling protection at extortionate rates.

This worldview went unquestioned until Thales of Miletus started searching for rational rather than supernatural explanations for the way the world worked. His thinking was followed up by a stream of great thinkers who speculated that the world was governed by a single substance. This school of thought then expanded to suggest that, aside from the known earth, water, wind and fire, there were many elements at play that made up the world and, by the early fifth century BC, the concept of tiny particles called atoms was first presented. </string>

In addition to their native conscripts, they consisted of many vassal and mercenary units. In Seleucid territories, these were used to support the limited numbers of immigrant Greek settlers that formed the mainstay of pike-armed phalanxes. Providing light infantry and cavalry, mercenaries and vassals would usually be employed to bolster the flanks.

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_civil_tribal_council_timber_trackway">The Celts were prolific road builders, sadly their track ways were constructed from wood and few have survived the ravages of time. Luckily, some passed through bogs and it is here that we have been able to learn more about the Celtic track ways. The Corlea bog in Ireland is home to one of the best preserved Celtic timber track ways; the tree-rings on the wood point to a tree-felling date of 148 BC, long before the Romans arrived and began building their stone roads.

However, these were heavy and cumbersome machines, requiring large operating crews. Loading and firing took time and left the crew members vulnerable to enemy attacks, particularly from fast-moving cavalry. Placing other units nearby to guard the crew members went some way to protecting them, but arming them and improving their personal armour allowed them to protect themselves.</string>

It would smash into the enemy’s hull, snaring the target and holding it by an immensely strong rope. The harpax was difficult to cut free and the stricken ship was usually forced to accept its fate as the often-heavier attacker reeled it in, smashing oars to immobilise the victim. Invented by Octavian’s renowned general, Agrippa, the harpax replaced the corvus as the preferred method of boarding ships to bring superior Roman hand-to-hand combat skills to bear.</string>

In the 8th century BC, the Greeks discovered that thrush droppings, when spread across a harvested field, could enrich the soil for the next crop. The Romans, concerned about the small amount of land available around the Mediterranean, became careful masters of their farm plots, practising mixed farming. They used “fallowing”, resting the land between harvests, to allow their animal herds to naturally fertilise the soil. The Roman statesmen, Cato the Elder, listed the most effective fertilisers as “...litter from stables, lupine, chaff, beanstalks, and the leaves of oak and holm-oak.” </string>

Annual floods renewed the soil’s fertility and the irrigated the surrounding land. By creating a series of man-made water works, the Egyptians could harness the life-giving powers of the Nile still further. Canals helped to form lakes which could be used as reservoirs to provide year-round irrigation. The creation of artificial lakes exploited this further, enabling the Egyptians to store supplies of water throughout the year. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_navy_improved_artillery">Traditionally, artillery in naval warfare was restricted to the use of javelin, slings and archers. It was the Syracusans who made the first steps towards creating artillery pieces that could be used at sea. They designed a contraption known as the “gastraphetes” or the “belly bow”. This oversized composite bow rested on the stomach of its user and was pulled back when braced by the user's feet. It could fire a substantial bolt some 50 yards further than a regular bow. This technology was then scaled up to form the basis of the early “Scorpion”, which eventually evolved into an array of torsion-powered artillery pieces that became commonplace on the decks of ancient ships. </string>

Whether worshipping a host of gods, such as the Greek or Persian pantheons; opposing forces of wisdom and destruction, as in Zoroastrianism; or monotheistic beliefs, such as Judaism, religious worship was everywhere. Tolerance of different beliefs was not always universal however, but with the movement of beliefs and philosophies, carried along the Royal and Silk Roads, and the spice routes, there was a great intermingling of religious ideas.</string>

By introducing land laws, the Romans sought to redistribute the land they had acquired through their military expansion. They attempted to limit the control of wealthy landowners on several occasions, but often faced obstruction and blatant flouting of the legislation by the privileged few. The most significant redistribution of Roman land came in the first century BC when land, mainly in Italy, was confiscated and shared amongst thousands of military veterans as payment for their years of service. </string>

When viewed as a whole the Coligny Calendar spans around 30 years, which some historians have come to view as a life time for the calendars creator. </string>

There were four types of consensual contract: “emptio-venditio” was a contract for the exchange of goods; “locatio-conductio” was a contract for the hire of goods; while “societas” governed partnerships.

His thinking was followed up by a stream of great thinkers who speculated that the world was governed by a single substance. This school of thought then expanded to suggest that, aside from the known earth, water, wind and fire, there were many elements at play that made up the world and, by the early fifth century BC, the concept of tiny particles called atoms was first presented. </string>

However, not everything was done for power, territory or wealth. In 22BC, Phraates IV of Parthia was able to negotiate the return of his son, who had been kidnapped by the usurper Tiridates when he had fled to Rome. In exchange for Phraates’ son, Augustus and the Senate were able to secure the return of the legionary standards that had been lost at the disastrous Battle of Carrhae some 33 years earlier.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_civil_agriculture_desert_reclamation">East and west of the fertile Nile Valley, Egypt was made up of vast areas of desert. Scattered amongst these deserts were oasis areas which were mainly used as military outposts and stop-overs for merchant caravans. Using a system of canals and reservoirs these oases could be expanded, reclaiming the desert for farming. Fayum, the most prominent oasis in the Western desert, was connected to the Nile via the Bahr Yusef canal and its agriculture thrived.

The origins of astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia with the Sumerians, whose knowledge passed to and was developed by the Babylonians. Their ideas were then accepted by the Greeks who were responsible for a number of key advances in astronomy, the most impressive of which so far discovered was the Antikythera mechanism. Found in a shipwreck, this device was an early analogue computer used to track the movement of the planets. Until its discovery in 1900 it was believed the first device of this kind hadn’t been invented until the 14th century.</string>

In the 8th century BC, the Greeks discovered that thrush droppings, when spread across a harvested field, could enrich the soil for the next crop. The Romans, concerned about the small amount of land available around the Mediterranean, became careful masters of their farm plots, practising mixed farming. They used “fallowing”, resting the land between harvests, to allow their animal herds to naturally fertilise the soil. The Roman statesmen, Cato the Elder, listed the most effective fertilisers as “...litter from stables, lupine, chaff, beanstalks, and the leaves of oak and holm-oak.” </string>

The Celts tended to mint their coins by casting gold, silver or bronze into moulds of burnt clay; each coin was then hammered between two stamps to give it its distinctive design. Just like any other rulers, Celtic leaders had coins minted with their names and faces on. Examples of these have been discovered, including coins minted for Cunobelinus, leader of the Britons and the mighty Gaul Vercingetorix. </string>

The nomadic tribes, and later merchants, played a vital role in distributing goods and raw materials. Merchants were given great freedom to conduct their activities but, when rivalry between cities escalated to violence, popular and rich trade routes became targets for tribal bandits. Powerful and wealthy individuals exploited such situations, with “caravan-chiefs” selling protection at extortionate rates. It often became necessary for governments to offer armed escorts, ensuring that valuable trade networks remained intact. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_military_war_exercises_cavalry_tactics">Roman writers often refused to acknowledge the skills possessed by the barbarians but there was one area of warfare which they freely admitted the Celts exceled at, horsemanship. The Greek historian Strabo stated that the finest cavalry in the whole Roman army were Celts. They were incredibly versatile troops, able to ride to the areas where they were needed and dismount to fight on foot. This was thanks to the cleverly designed bridles worn by their horses; they had a small peg that could be staked in to the ground to keep the horse in place while its rider fought.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_civil_philosophy_tophet">The topic of Carthaginian child sacrifice is a heated one still disputed by many historians and archaeologists. Some primary sources, such as Diodorus Siculus, suggested that the Tophet, or roasting place, was a giant bronze statue with outstretched hands that sloped down into a fiery pit. The child would be placed into the statue's hands and given to the flames and the god Ba’al Hammon. The discovery of mass child graveyards would seem to support these ancient texts, but some historians argue that it is simply a sign of a civilisation with a high infant mortality rate.</string>

Early Phoenician ships had pointed rams that were sheathed in bronze and positioned under the waterline. This type of ram often saw the attacker impaled in its victim and unable to break free. By the fourth century, the ram evolved to feature multiple blades above and below the waterline. The Greeks developed a blunt bronze ram which was designed to smash the enemy hull rather than pierce it, enabling them to attack, break free and watch their stricken foes sink. </string>

In 44BC, Augustus and his friend Agrippa, both young men at the time, consulted the Greek astrologer Theogenes.

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_military_war_exercises_servants_of_the_elite">The relationship between knight and squire in medieval warfare is well known, but less is known of a Celtic practice which shares a number of similarities.

This not only allowed them to fight in their own styles using their own chants and war dances but created rivalry and encouraged the tribes to prove their prowess in battle to their neighbours. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_farming_crop_rotation">Planting the same crop on the same plot of land can gradually strip the soil of its nutrients, weakening the plant and inviting pests. Ancient farmers found that by carefully managing a plot these effects would subside, the soil would recover its fertility and the crop would strengthen with each passing year. Various methodologies were practiced, including two, three and even four cycles of planting, with climate dictating the complexity of rotation and the crops that could be grown. One of the most popular techniques was the “food, feed, fallow” system. This saw farmers divide fields into three sections and in each, start with a wheat crop, followed by a vegetable or cereal for livestock feed and finally, the land would be left “fallow”, or unused, to replenish its nutrients. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_philosophy_hippocratic_oath">Based on the writings of Hippocrates, the Greek physician labeled the “father of medicine”, the Hippocratic Oath forms the basis of medical ethics which are still honoured today.

The oath also stated that a physician would never administer poisons, divulge patient information or carry out an abortion, and would refrain from “mischief” and attempting any sexual advances on a patient, regardless of whether they were free or a slave.</string>

Fore-and-aft rigging was the solution to that problem. In this system, the sail is set parallel to the keel of the vessel, rather than at right-angles. This allows greater manoeuvrability when facing into the wind. While fore-and-aft rigging did not become widespread until many centuries later, there is ample evidence to confirm that it was employed by ancient shipwrights with the “sprit”, the triangular lateen and the quadrilateral lateen all in use. </string>

While Greek architects were slower to embrace new materials and techniques than their Roman counterparts, architecture advanced significantly between 350BC and 100BC.

The tribes of Britain and Ireland constructed artificial islands known as ‘crannogs’ in rivers and lakes. They varied in complexity from mounds of peat and brush to structures with boulder foundations supporting wooden pile and beam platforms that sat just above the water level. Some even had drawbridges that provided their occupants with protection from sudden attacks. </string>

Once the two champions had done battle the victor would win the war for his tribe and they would return home. However, the Romans did not hold to these traditions and even if a Celtic champion beat a Roman in single combat they would fall on the unsuspecting Celts and exact revenge for their fallen comrade.</string>

He gave his life to the army, never wavering to think on what awaited him back home. However, when a state discharged these men without suitable reward, they often turned to their generals. If successful in finding the spoils to offer his men, a general could exert huge influence and power. In 88BC Sulla was the first aggrieved general to march his men towards Rome, an act which led to many “marches on Rome” led by power hungry generals, followed by strong and powerful armies. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_management_training_reforms">"With the Marius reforms joining the Roman army became a full-time occupation. Men trained all year round, not just during the campaign season when Rome was under threat. 

Legionaries were expected to be able to fight in a number of formations with a variety of weapons. These skills were then tested in mock training battles. The captured Jewish leader, Josephus, witnessed such drills and offered a vivid account of the violence that took place “...it would be fair enough to call their drills bloodless battles and their battles bloody drills”."</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_siege_armoured_siege_engineers">Large torsion-powered catapults and siege engines were powerful weapons that could devastate densely packed enemies in open battle, or topple walls during sieges. However, these were heavy and cumbersome machines, requiring large operating crews. Loading and firing took time and left the crew members vulnerable to enemy attacks, particularly from fast-moving cavalry. Placing other units nearby to guard the crew members went some way to protecting them, but arming them and improving their personal armour allowed them to protect themselves.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_engineering_siege_boiling_oil">"The passive protection of walls was never enough to keep out attackers. Defenders began experimenting with other ways to repel invading enemy forces, and one such method was the use of boiling oil. The Roman army encountered it at the siege of Jotapata. The historian Josephus described the effect the oil had on the Roman soldiers, ""the oil did easily run down the whole body from head to foot, under their armour, and fed upon their flesh like flame itself."""</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_tactics_testudo_formation">The Testudo, or “tortoise”, was an impressive defensive formation employed by the Roman army. Legionaries, up to a full century of 80 men, would overlap their shields with the outside ranks presenting theirs outwards, while those in the centre of the formation held their shields above their heads to form a roof. After rigorous training this roof was strong enough to support a chariot! During the Roman Civil War of 69AD, a group of besieged Romans resorted to pushing one of their hefty catapults off a wall to crush the testudo below. While this shattered the locked shields of the testudo, it also smashed the rampart and allowed the enemy in through the breach in the walls.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_agriculture_beekeeping">Beekeeping was a lucrative if somewhat complicated art. Meeting the optimum conditions for bees was a Herculean task: the climate had to be warm but not sweltering, with hives located near reliable food sources and water supplies. Separating the bees from their honey was also demanding. Dry dung mixed with coal was burnt in a pot and the smoke was poured into the hive to force the bees out. Once the combs were gathered they had to be drained of honey and kept out of reach of the angry bees.</string>

Mounds and long barrows, on the other hand, were much smaller and were used specifically for burials. The purpose of some earthworks, like henges and stone circles, remains mysterious even today, although it is widely believed that had a ritual purpose. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_farming_improved_irrigation">In its most basic form, irrigation takes water from an available natural source and diverts it to crops through man-made channels or ponds. The Egyptians had little need for such methods thanks to the River Nile which naturally flooded their farmlands every year. The Egyptians perfected systems that diverted the flooding of the Nile to irrigate their crops and deposit the river’s nutrient-rich silt. For those less fortunate, engineering offered the opportunity to improve on primitive methods. The most effective early techniques involved the building of diversion dams that could channel water from a river or stream into a canal.</string>

Mistletoe was the most sacred of all these plants and gathering it was an important druidic ritual. The chief druid used a golden hook to remove the sprigs of mistletoe from the oak; they were then carefully caught in a white cloth, as they were never allowed to touch the ground. As a gift from the gods, mistletoe was thought to be a remedy for any known poison, as well as a cure for impotency. </string>

However, an army’s movement could be severely hampered by its supply train and it was the Greeks who revolutionised military supply and logistics. They disbanded the legion of attendants and wives that trailed behind every army, and introduced the speedier horse and mule to replace the ox-drawn carts. They also made the soldiers carry more. The creation of standardised coinage also allowed states to provide for their armies in enemy territory, because their money could be trusted, with some merchants evolving into the first military contractors. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_philosophy_scholarship">The ancient scholars questioned the world around them and gradually began forming disciplines such as astronomy, geography, mathematics, medicine and philosophy to define their discoveries. Some of these early scholars went on to become the greatest thinkers of their day, forming schools to pass on their knowledge to others. The Egyptian city of Alexandria was the academic centre of the ancient world, home to a vast library of documentation and scrolls. It was a place of intellectual pilgrimage for all enquiring minds.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_civil_agriculture_animal_husbandry">Breeding and raising livestock was a profitable activity for landowners, requiring far less labour and investment than arable farming. While animals were kept for meat, wool and dairy products for centuries and animal husbandry practised across the ancient world, it was the Romans who truly developed the art. Through selective breeding, the Romans produced bigger, stronger livestock which provided more meat, milk, cheese and wool. They also developed fish farms, to satisfy the demand for fresh fish in inland provinces. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_engineering_siege_great_food_vault">Storing large amounts of food became incredibly important as the Romans invaded. Sieges could last for months and starving a population out of their home was a popular Roman tactic. It was employed by Caesar at the Siege of Alesia in 52BC, the battle that ultimately won him the war in Gaul. Conditions became so dire in Alesia that Vercingetorix was forced to eject all the women and children from the city, hoping to save food for the warriors and trusting that the Romans would allow the civilians to flee to safety. However, Caesar issued orders that no exits were to be made in the siege works and the women and children starved to death between the walls of their home and the Roman siege works. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_warrior_code_tribal_totem">Animal totems played an important role in barbarian myths and legends. Many, like the pig or the serpent, were links between our world and the Otherworld. Some were seen as omens, a white stag for example was a sign of the ‘wild hunt’ a group of ghostly hunters who rode through the sky looking for the spirits of the recently deceased. Others, like the bear, the boar and the bull, were worshipped for their strength and power and featured heavily in weapon and shield design. </string>

It mapped the heavens, allowing accurate predictions of when and where stars would appear in the sky. It was a star chart, and an aid in all kinds of navigational and calendrical calculations. An example from a master craftsman could also be an extremely beautiful and expensive object."</string>
<string name="technologies_short_description_rom_greek_civil_philosophy_natural_philosophy">Pure thought must eventually give way to practical evidence.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_tactics_advanced_cavalry_tactics">The horsemen of Parthia, Armenia and Sarmatia were some of the finest in the ancient world. Their complex formations and tactics were so effective that other armies, including the Romans, rushed to copy them. The Cantabrian Circle, a fast-moving cavalry formation, was adopted by the Roman army shortly after the Cantabrian Wars. Riders would form a loose circle, each horse following the next at full gallop and as the riders came round to face the enemy they would loose their arrows. This deadly formation presented a difficult target for enemy archers and provided a constant stream of deadly arrow fire. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_siege_ammunition_stores">Artillery provided defenders with greater firepower, but created a need to produce and store large amounts of ammunition. Stone balls of varying sizes were stored within fortifications for use when the time came. Excavations in Carthage and the Greek city of Dora provide evidence that large-scale production of ammunition took place in order to prepare for the onset of any siege. Over 5600 artillery balls have been found within the site of Carthage; they predate the Roman attack on the city that burnt it to the ground in 146BC. </string>

Language skills became almost as valuable as spices. In eastern kingdoms, Aramaic remained the recognised language of trade, but a knowledge of the basics of Greek and Latin became essential as many goods, particularly spices, became sought after commodities in the west.</string>

So great was their love for these beasts that they built stables large enough to house 400 elephants within the walls of Carthage. They favoured North African elephants, a species thought to be smaller than their Indian and sub-Saharan African cousins, and use of the breed eventually drove it to extinction. As native stocks dwindled, Carthage started importing elephants for use in war; Hannibal’s favourite elephant Surus was believed to be from Syria. </string>

Evaporation was kept to a minimum, and the systems used groundwater, a more reliable source than seasonal rivers. A horizontal tunnel was dug, by hand, into a cliff or mountainside. Vertical shafts were then cut into it to allow ventilation and easy access to keep the main tunnel clean. Cleaning was a task often carried out by children who were lowered down through the vertical shafts on ropes and buckets.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_military_war_exercises_trimarcisia">Trimarcisia is the Celtic practice of taking two ‘servants’ in to battle to act as attendants and was first recorded by the Greek writer Pausanias.

These servants remained behind the ranks until their charge needed a new mount, was injured or killed.

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_economy_legal_institutions">By introducing a set of laws that are not entirely subject to the whims of the ruler, legal institutions provided a framework of rules that decided how wealth could and should be distributed. Some of the greatest advances made in this area were put forward by a jurist known simply as Gaius. He wrote many great works on the finer points of Roman law but he is best known for his work “The Institutions of Gaius”. It was broken into four sections that discussed how people, things, intestate succession and actions should be governed by law. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_warrior_code_animal_imitation">Barbarian tribes believed fervently in the power of nature, especially that of wild beasts. By wearing wolf, bear or boar skins warriors could channel their power, be it speed, strength or ferocity, in the heat of battle. Having a shared association with a specific animal may also have created a brotherhood amongst warriors, who in effect became a pack. The Germanic tribes were known for their association with wolves and wolf-warriors are even shown fighting as part of the Roman army on Trajan’s column in Rome. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_economy_production_lines">As ever-increasing populations demanded more goods it became necessary to explore the principles of mass-production. This led to the development of piecework: the construction of component parts that could be produced quickly and in large quantities. Teams of workers would then assemble these parts into goods. Roman philosopher and writer, Pliny the Elder, tells of shops dedicated to the production of individual chandelier parts. There is also evidence to suggest that factory-like production was in place in urban areas for the manufacture of pots, building parts and military items.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_engineering_construction_crane">The Romans adopted the principle of the crane from the Greeks and modified its design to create apparatus capable of lifting huge weights. Some of Rome’s most magnificent buildings undoubtedly benefitted from the use of cranes. The Parthenon, for example, has sections which weigh up to nine tonnes each and that needed to be lifted over nine metres. It is thought that the Romans designed and used two types of crane. The first, the “polyspastos”, had a jib built from two timber beams in an inverted v-shape; the thickness and length of these beams would determine the weight the crane could carry. The second crane type, the “rispastos”, used a single beam jib and could be swung sideways but was not able to bear heavy loads.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_construction_improved_fortifications">The need for settlements to withstand attacks led to the construction of many impressive defensive structures. The formidable twin walls of Babylon were an early example. A wonder of the ancient world, its multi-layered defences were built from baked brick and reinforced by a surrounding moat. Greek historian Diodorus stated that the construction took 200,000 men a full year to complete. On standing before them, Cyrus the Great, commander of the besieging Medo-Persian forces exclaimed “I am unable to see how any enemy can take walls of such strength and height by assault”. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_warrior_code_war_dance">War dances allowed warriors to lose themselves in the rhythm, clearing their minds and increasing their heart rate. This was particularly useful during battle when an unfocused mind could get a warrior killed. Each tribe had its own songs and dances, the Celts were known for advancing into battle with a rhythmic step, clashing their shields and shouting the name of their tribe. The Germanic tribes danced for a number of reasons including; honouring their dead, to hail a speech, to gloat over a captured banner or simply to celebrate a victory.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_construction_dioptra">The dioptra was first used by the Greek astronomers to fix the position of the stars. However, when this was superseded by a more accurate device, the armillary sphere, it found a new function as a surveying tool. It was a portable instrument that could be used to measure distances, angular measurements or work as a level. The dioptra could assess both the horizontal and vertical planes, allowing for readings of the deviation between two set locations, so offering accurate measurement of any angles involved. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_navy_oak_construction">Sacred to many barbarian tribes, the oak was believed to possess great spiritual strength and act as a gateway to the Otherworld. As a ship building material it provided incredible hull strength, which was vital for ships sailing the rough Atlantic tides. Both Caesar and Strabo wrote of the strength of the warships built by the Veneti tribe, stating that ramming attacks did very little damage to the strong oak hulls, forcing the Romans to develop new tactics to defeat the Veneti. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_engineering_siege_improved_defensive_artillery">As armies strengthened their siege engines and developed artillery capable of pummelling settlement walls, defenders were forced to adapt their tactics and equipment to counter the threat. A gateway flanked by towers was no longer enough to repel a determined foe. Defensive towers and platforms grew to accommodate not only archers and slingers, but also artillery engines as well. During the siege of Lilybaeum in 274BC, the Carthaginians placed catapults along the length of their walls to fend off the armies of Pyrrhus; his men were forced to abandon the attack by the weight of the defensive artillery bombardment.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_siege_onager">Roman siege equipment was, with the exception of some specialist pieces, always constructed on campaign. This meant that those who were expected to use the siege equipment needed a good level of engineering knowledge. As well as a working knowledge of the workings of their machinery they were expected to carefully manage the projectiles, making sure that they were the correct weight and could achieve the range required.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_tribal_council_written_language">It has often been stated that the Celts did not keep written records, which is simply not true. Although the druids believed that their teaching should never be written down there is no evidence that this belief extended to other areas of society. In fact, there are a large number of artefacts that prove that the Celts could not only write but were proficient in a number of dialects including Greek, Etruscan and Latin. The earliest examples of Celtic text were written in the Etruscan alphabet and date back to the sixth century BC. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_management_remuneration_reforms">The military reforms of Gaius Marius marked a significant change in pay for Roman soldiers. Legionaries did not consider the new annual salary of 100 denari, complimented by payment in land or cash up to 3,000 denarii, suitable payment for 25 years hard service. Veteran troops looked to their consuls, frequently their former generals, for more suitable recompense for their efforts, causing inevitable political unrest and eventually, civil war. Emperor Augustus restored stability in the first century BC and was quick to identify the role that the dissatisfied legions had played in the years of strife. He set up the Aerarium Militare, the Military Treasury, a pot of money initiated by his own funds and topped up by regular citizen tax payments; it provided soldiers with a pension equivalent to 14 years' pay. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_navy_double_plank_construction">Ship construction in the ancient world developed in response to the perceived need for bigger, stronger vessels. Double planking allowed the ancient shipwrights to build vast, strong hulls whilst keeping the ships light and manoeuvrable. The technique used two types of wood, with the inner layer constructed from a softer material than the exterior. In some cases a layer of lead separated the two woods in vulnerable areas of the ship, while cloth or wool soaked in wax would also be placed between the layers to add waterproofing. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_top_social_organisation">Composed of diverse cultures, eastern states had many different forms of social hierarchy. Those following Alexander the Great's empire, such as the Seleucids, usually followed their Hellenic traditions and maintained a great deal of Greek culture. Over time, the native nobility would adopt these ways, often as a means of advancement, creating a Hellenised elite. Underneath them were native peoples and an ever-increasing influx of colonists, all too busy trying to live to worry about much beyond their homes and food. In contrast, the great Parthian kings embraced their Persian heritage, reviving many of their traditions.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_tactics_tactical_drills">As armies adopted flexible forces, subdivided into units, each with their individual function and strengths, tactical drills became the difference between victory and defeat. Layered tactical manoeuvres could be planned and executed to counter any enemy and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The Roman army undoubtedly set the standard and demonstrated the gains from their disciplined tactics in numerous battles, not least when faced with war elephants at the Battle of Zama in 202BC. Here the Romans effortlessly moved as one to create open lanes in their formation, allowing the rampaging beasts to charge harmlessly through their ranks.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_engineering_construction_dry_stone_construction">The misconception that the Celtic people were a wandering band of bloodthirsty warriors is easy to disprove. Dry stone buildings constructed in the fourth century BC still stand all over Europe, as a testament to the construction techniques of the Celts. Mousa Broch on the Shetland Islands has survived the harsh weather conditions and is the tallest surviving example of a broch in the world. Its walls are so thick that they are able to house a staircase that is still climbable today and gives access to the multiple floors within this impressive piece of early architecture. </string>

However, with writing skills far from widespread the ""stipulatio"", a basic contract between two parties, was agreed orally by all parties. This form of agreement was the norm in Rome and it took time for written contracts to be accepted. Greek law, on the other hand, had always been based on the principles of written contracts and their influence gradually encouraged the Romans to bind oral contracts within written terms. "</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_philosophy_field_surgery">Although medical treatment still relied on a certain amount of mysticism, the Romans and Greeks made many great discoveries thanks, in part, to the large number of injured men on hand as experimental subjects. Wine was used as an antiseptic, the alcohol content helping to clean the wound and keep infection at bay. Opium poppies and henbane seeds were used as painkillers, and surgeons could even lave spilled innards with a concoction of oil and water before packing them back into the owner's abdomen. </string>

It was their tactics that really set them apart: tactical retreats and carefully laid ambushes kept the Romans afraid to venture too far from their camps and taught them to fear the rattle and stamp of approaching chariots.</string>

They were slowly added to over time and large reinforced limestone ramparts provided protection for a population of several hundred. Perhaps the most interesting of Maiden Castle’s defences is its ammunition store. A large pit found just inside the east gate containing 20,000 carefully chosen pebbles that would have been used as ammunition for slingshots during sieges.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_economy_preferred_markets">Trade, in particular, transactions carried out with partners across long distances, was hugely profitable, and cities located along established trade routes were thrived. Such was the importance of market location, and the routes taken by merchants and their caravans, that central government often made it their business to control them. By dictating preferred routes governments could exert some control on who gained from the prosperity that booming trade brought. It allowed the government  to select those who grew rich and those who were doomed to poverty.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_economy_formal_government">Eastern kingdoms, such as the Seleucids and Parthians, relied on a formalised structure of government to administer their territories. This was modelled on the system of the Achaemenid Empire, conquered by Alexander the Great, with Persian concepts such as satraps continuing to be used. In the case of the Seleucids, their centralised system eventually fragmented into separate kingdoms, such as Armenia and Bactria. In contrast, the decentralised government of the Parthian Empire, in which many kingdoms paid tribute to a King of Kings, fared better until its replacement by the Sassanid Empire in 224 AD.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_tactics_tactical_flexibility">The heavy phalanx did not disappear from the Hellenistic world overnight, but there was a definite move to compliment it with more flexible and mobile fighting forces, made up of light troops and cavalry. Greek armies began to equip their troops with lighter armour and placed greater emphasis on skirmishing and one-on-one combat. They developed the “thureophoroi” infantryman, a soldier equipped with the oval thureos shield, thought to be modelled on the Roman scutum. More mobile than a hoplite, these men could protect and reinforce the phalanx, attack an enemy from the flanks and generally bridge the gap between the heavy spearman and the light peltast skirmisher. </string>

The storms that racked their lands and the gentle rain that helped to grow their crops were all sent for a reason. It is this deep respect for the natural world that leads many scholars to believe that these tribes would have chosen to worship in the open air, as close to nature as possible. The work of Greek writer Strabo supports this theory, he wrote that the Celts of Galatia met annually at the ‘Drunemeton’ or ‘Oak Sanctuary’ to resolve important religious and political issues.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_military_top_foraging">When fighting in foreign lands an army lives or dies on its foraging abilities. The ancient Celts were well aware of this fact and made it incredibly difficult for the Romans to gather food during their invasion. Should a careless General send a small party of men out to forage for food the tribes would make sure those men were never seen again. After losing several parties this way, Caesar started sending entire legions to guard his foragers. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_management_professional_soldiery">Traditionally, the citizen armies of the ancient world were supplied by a combination of levies and volunteer troops. Often farmers and landowners, these men ultimately looked to return to their plots and families, comforted by the spoils of war. The professional solider was a different beast entirely. He gave his life to the army, never wavering to think on what awaited him back home. However, when a state discharged these men without suitable reward, they often turned to their generals. If successful in finding the spoils to offer his men, a general could exert huge influence and power. In 88BC Sulla was the first aggrieved general to march his men towards Rome, an act which led to many “marches on Rome” led by power hungry generals, followed by strong and powerful armies. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_engineering_siege_onager">Roman siege equipment was, with the exception of some specialist pieces, always constructed on campaign.

There were a range of recognised tactics, including the “periplous” - an outflanking manoeuvre - and the “diekplous” - a more complex movement which was also known as “breaking the line”. Here an attacking ship would navigate between two enemy vessels and rely on superior speed and agility to ram the midships or stern of its target. This tactic could be aided by sailing close enough to the enemy to shear off their oars, immobilising them before ramming. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_farming_grain_kiln">Grain kilns were used to dry out grain before it could be stored, this was particularly important in the damp climates of Britain and Ireland. The kilns consisted of a sunken pit which was then covered over using a wide variety of materials that included sods, wood and in some cases stone. A peat fire would then heat the kernels, causing them to harden; this allowed the tribes to store more grain for longer periods of time and was especially useful through the harsh cold winters. </string>

The most devastating blow was often delivered to the stern, although broadside impacts were more common and didn’t require as much speed to inflict damage.

A lone elephant could inflict heavy damage to a unit of infantry or a poorly defended gatehouse, but the Ghaznavids were not satisfied by this and developed an elaborate ramming device that was powered by no less than five elephants. This powerful siege weapon was transported by four beasts while a fifth, controlled by a driver, the ‘mahout’, pushed and pulled the iron tipped ram.</string>

Double planking allowed the ancient shipwrights to build vast, strong hulls whilst keeping the ships light and manoeuvrable. The technique used two types of wood, with the inner layer constructed from a softer material than the exterior. In some cases a layer of lead separated the two woods in vulnerable areas of the ship, while cloth or wool soaked in wax would also be placed between the layers to add waterproofing. </string>
<string name="technologies_onscreen_name_rom_egypt_civil_top_land_management">Land Management</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_economy_land_management">With developments in trade and transport, land could be used to reap huge profits from crops grown to meet demands for food across the known world. Land became the favoured form of investment as the big estate owners looked to manage their estates carefully to maximise production and profit. Increasing the peasant labour force was the simplest method of getting more from arable farmland, but there was also the option of investing in animal husbandry or leasing plots to tenant farmers to profit from rents.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_philosophy_philhellenism">"In antiquity, the term ""philhellene"" refered to non-Greeks who were interested in Greek culture and also to Greeks keen to uphold their culture and traditions. In Pontus, for example, the Persian aristocracy adopted many Greek customs and trappings, enabling them to better manage their Greek colonists. They, in turn, sought to maintain their cultural identity and friendly relations with neighbouring Hellenic states. During the Mithridatic Wars, between the Kingdom of Pontus and Rome in the 1st century BC, Mithridates VI took philhellenism a stage further, presenting himself as the defender of all Hellenic culture and Greece in particular. It was a useful piece of political posturing."</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_agriculture_fertilisation">As civilisations became more dependent on a limited area of arable land they were forced to manage soil quality carefully. In the 8th century BC, the Greeks discovered that thrush droppings, when spread across a harvested field, could enrich the soil for the next crop. The Romans, concerned about the small amount of land available around the Mediterranean, became careful masters of their farm plots, practising mixed farming. They used “fallowing”, resting the land between harvests, to allow their animal herds to naturally fertilise the soil. The Roman statesmen, Cato the Elder, listed the most effective fertilisers as “...litter from stables, lupine, chaff, beanstalks, and the leaves of oak and holm-oak.” </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_engineering_construction_advanced_construction_techniques">As building materials became more understood and skills developed amongst architects and builders, new construction techniques became possible. Domes, arches and vaults became regular features in Roman architecture but a true dome was perhaps the pinnacle achievement of architects and builders of the time. They posed complex puzzles when it came to supporting the weight of the structure as it was being built, and it took time and a certain amount of trial and error for architects to perfect the system. The Pantheon in Rome is one of the best examples of a true dome and suggests that by 128AD, architects had mastered the form.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_navy_marine_training">The marines of ancient Greece were paid volunteers who tended to be from the lower citizen classes. This was possibly because they were more likely to be available for naval service because they were not liable for regular hoplite service. Fighting from the deck of a moving ship required skills that could only be developed through experience, so it is likely that the soldiers employed by Greek navies made their living as marines. Despite their low birth, marines were next to the captain in a ship's hierarchy and took part in ceremonies and political discussions.

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_druidism_druidic_doctrine">Druids acted as knowledge keepers in many barbarian societies. Afraid their secrets may pass into the wrong hands, they never wrote anything down and information was passed verbally.  Stories were passed down from generation to generation in poetry, song and dance. Classical sources, including Strabo and Caesar, suggested that it could take up to twenty years for a druid to learn everything they were expected to know. This was not limited to folktales and rituals, druids were also expected to memorize long and complex law codes and pass judgement on legal cases.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_engineering_siege_improved_defensive_artillery">As armies strengthened their siege engines and developed artillery capable of pummelling settlement walls, defenders were forced to adapt their tactics and equipment to counter the threat.

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_construction_improved_port_construction">The port of Carthage was the largest in the ancient world. An impressive circular site, it had huge inner and outer walls that were accessed via a canal. The inner wall harboured Carthage’s fleet of warships, as well as a repair dock and the palace of the head of the Carthaginian navy. The outer wall housed the huge merchant fleet that brought the wealth of the Mediterranean world to Carthage. Little remains of the ancient port of Carthage today. The ruins found in Tunisia are those of a Roman port constructed after the destruction of Carthage.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_management_military_settlement">For centuries it was deemed unnecessary to pay soldiers, let alone provide them with a pension on retirement. Military service was seen as a privilege, duty and price of citizenship. Soldiers paid their own way, supplying their own weapons and equipment. In order to recruit larger, professional, full-time armies, it became sensible to pay troops and offer land on completion of military service. During the Peloponnesian War, Athens provided their troops with a living allowance which then progressed to full remuneration. Other Greek cities swiftly followed, and the military landscape began its transformation, as armies turned professional rather than being citizen militias.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_military_warrior_code_war_dance">War dances allowed warriors to lose themselves in the rhythm, clearing their minds and increasing their heart rate. This was particularly useful during battle when an unfocused mind could get a warrior killed. Each tribe had its own songs and dances, the Celts were known for advancing into battle with a rhythmic step, clashing their shields and shouting the name of their tribe. The Germanic tribes danced for a number of reasons including; honouring their dead, to hail a speech, to gloat over a captured banner or simply to celebrate a victory.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_engineering_siege_battering_ram">Battering rams in their simplest form have existed for millennia. Some clever individual discovered that running a large log at gates seemed to be an effective way of knocking them down. It was only a short time until bigger and better designs appeared, usually involving decorating the ram with a ram's head. The Macedonians made many advances in siege craft, including the introduction of the covered battering-ram, the cunning invention of Polyidus of Thessaly who served Philip II of Macedon.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_engineering_siege_siege_tower">Siege towers were huge feats of engineering, sometimes reaching six storeys in height. Any defenders seeing one approaching would instantly do all in their power to halt the tower's advance. Flaming arrows and boiling oil were obvious choices, which allowed the Romans to develop defensive countermeasures for towers. Wet cow skins were often fixed to the frame and men were stationed inside the tower equipped with water hoses made of pickled cow intestines to put out fires.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_engineering_construction_crane">The Romans adopted the principle of the crane from the Greeks and modified its design to create apparatus capable of lifting huge weights. Some of Rome’s most magnificent buildings undoubtedly benefitted from the use of cranes. The Parthenon, for example, has sections which weigh up to nine tonnes each and that needed to be lifted over nine metres. It is thought that the Romans designed and used two types of crane. The first, the “polyspastos”, had a jib built from two timber beams in an inverted v-shape; the thickness and length of these beams would determine the weight the crane could carry. The second crane type, the “rispastos”, used a single beam jib and could be swung sideways but was not able to bear heavy loads.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_civil_farming_souterrain">Souterrains, sometimes known as fougou, were huge pits used by the Celts to store food. For many years archaeologists were baffled as to how vegetables and grain could remain dry in such conditions, but now, thanks to experiments done at Butser Celtic Farm in Hampshire, they have their answer. With the pit sealed contact with the damp walls caused the grain to germinate, using the available oxygen and dispelling carbon dioxide. The rest of the grain would then enter a form of suspended animation, allowing it to remain in perfect condition for months.  </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_engineering_construction_stone_footing">Many of the largest Celtic settlements were constructed overlooking or near to rivers. The Arevaci capital Numantia was constructed overlooking the River Douro; this 20 hectare settlement was inhabited from ancient times but reached the height of its prosperity in the third century BC. It contained both stone and timber buildings, both built on stone foundations. Little of the settlement remains to this day as the Romans systematically destroyed it and sold its occupants into slavery. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_top_logistics">"An army can live off the land in most places, although deserts are an obvious exception. Foraging parties can take food and animal fodder from locals. Working parties can collect firewood as needed. Petty offenders can be made to dig latrines every night as the army camps. Slingers can find a ready resupply of pebbles as missiles wherever there is a beach or riverbed. What can’t be stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried with the army: arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load; medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable as opposed to just plain miserable. 

Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars.

He had been commissioned by Ptolemy II to write a history of all Egyptian lands and, using temple records and the king lists of the time, he created a system that provides a basis for Egyptian history to this day. Prior to Manetho’s work, entitled “Aegyptica”, lists of rulers were maintained for sacred purposes, helping to reinforce the legitimacy of the Pharaohs. </string>

Starvation is a constant threat: what food is within the walls is all that there will be until the siege is ended. Those who cannot fight must be made to leave, preferably before the siege begins. Food supplies then last longer. 

At the Battle of Alesia in 52BC the decision to expel women and children from the fortifications was made too late. Throwing out non-combatants meant more food for the fighters, but the Romans would not allow refugees through their lines. The women and children starved in the no-man’s land between the two armies. Their agonies were watched, from the safety of the walls, by their own menfolk."</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_agriculture_crop_rotation">Planting the same crop on the same plot of land can gradually strip the soil of its nutrients, weakening the plant and inviting pests. Ancient farmers found that by carefully managing a plot these effects would subside, the soil would recover its fertility and the crop would strengthen with each passing year. Various methodologies were practiced, including two, three and even four cycles of planting, with climate dictating the complexity of rotation and the crops that could be grown. One of the most popular techniques was the “food, feed, fallow” system. This saw farmers divide fields into three sections and in each, start with a wheat crop, followed by a vegetable or cereal for livestock feed and finally, the land would be left “fallow”, or unused, to replenish its nutrients. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_management_remuneration_reforms">The military reforms of Gaius Marius marked a significant change in pay for Roman soldiers. Legionaries did not consider the new annual salary of 100 denari, complimented by payment in land or cash up to 3,000 denarii, suitable payment for 25 years hard service. Veteran troops looked to their consuls, frequently their former generals, for more suitable recompense for their efforts, causing inevitable political unrest and eventually, civil war. Emperor Augustus restored stability in the first century BC and was quick to identify the role that the dissatisfied legions had played in the years of strife. He set up the Aerarium Militare, the Military Treasury, a pot of money initiated by his own funds and topped up by regular citizen tax payments; it provided soldiers with a pension equivalent to 14 years' pay. </string>

They passed judgement on murderers, disputes of inheritance or boundaries and even appointed the compensation to be paid and received. Should an individual refuse to accept druidic judgement they would be banned from taking part in sacrifices, the worst punishment that could be inflicted. They were then treated as outcasts, denied any future justice and excluded from a share of any honour won in battle. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_tactics_tactical_drills">As armies adopted flexible forces, subdivided into units, each with their individual function and strengths, tactical drills became the difference between victory and defeat. Layered tactical manoeuvres could be planned and executed to counter any enemy and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The Roman army undoubtedly set the standard and demonstrated the gains from their disciplined tactics in numerous battles, not least when faced with war elephants at the Battle of Zama in 202BC. Here the Romans effortlessly moved as one to create open lanes in their formation, allowing the rampaging beasts to charge harmlessly through their ranks.</string>

By dictating preferred routes governments could exert some control on who gained from the prosperity that booming trade brought.

Often farmers and landowners, these men ultimately looked to return to their plots and families, comforted by the spoils of war. The professional solider was a different beast entirely. He gave his life to the army, never wavering to think on what awaited him back home. However, when a state discharged these men without suitable reward, they often turned to their generals. If successful in finding the spoils to offer his men, a general could exert huge influence and power. In 88BC Sulla was the first aggrieved general to march his men towards Rome, an act which led to many “marches on Rome” led by power hungry generals, followed by strong and powerful armies. </string>

Bog bodies have been discovered across the areas of Europe inhabited by barbarian tribes and all exhibit similar injuries, leading some historians to suggest that peat bogs may have had religious significance. </string>

This meant that those who were expected to use the siege equipment needed a good level of engineering knowledge. As well as a working knowledge of the workings of their machinery they were expected to carefully manage the projectiles, making sure that they were the correct weight and could achieve the range required.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_economy_land_tax">Taxing the land, or rather the the harvest of the land, was one of the most common and efficient ways a government could employ to gather wealth from its people. Typically, land tax was calculated according to the size of owner's estate. Controversially, the tax could be applied prior to the harvest meaning that, should drought or flood rob the farmer of his crop, he would still be expected to pay his taxes based on the yield he should have gained from the land.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_civil_top_celtic_field_systems">Celtic field systems are small, square plots of land whose size and shape are often attributed to the fact that they would have been worked by one family. The term ‘Celtic field’ was coined by archaeologist O.G.S Crawford. He came across the distinctive patchwork pattern while examining photographs, taken by the Royal Air Force, of the Salisbury Plain area of Britain. Excavation of these areas revealed that they had been inhabited and worked as farmland since the Early Bronze age. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_engineering_construction_dioptra">The dioptra was first used by the Greek astronomers to fix the position of the stars. However, when this was superseded by a more accurate device, the armillary sphere, it found a new function as a surveying tool. It was a portable instrument that could be used to measure distances, angular measurements or work as a level. The dioptra could assess both the horizontal and vertical planes, allowing for readings of the deviation between two set locations, so offering accurate measurement of any angles involved. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_philosophy_state_banking">The first form of banking was carried out by priests, with temples housing deposits and authenticating coinage, exchanging gold and dealing with loans. Throughout Greece, religious buildings doubled as financial institutions, with the Parthenon in Athens at the centre of the Greek financial world. The first bankers began to emerge around the 4th Century BC when money-changers, who were normally alien residents or “metics”, set up tables in markets for loans and money exchanges. These lenders went on to become fully-fledged bankers, and state banking was gradually established as the depositing of money moved from the temples to state-run institutions.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_engineering_construction_large_defences">Maiden Castle in Dorset was thought to have incredible defences that were constructed as far back as 350 BC. They were slowly added to over time and large reinforced limestone ramparts provided protection for a population of several hundred. Perhaps the most interesting of Maiden Castle’s defences is its ammunition store. A large pit found just inside the east gate containing 20,000 carefully chosen pebbles that would have been used as ammunition for slingshots during sieges.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_civil_farming_grain_kiln">Grain kilns were used to dry out grain before it could be stored, this was particularly important in the damp climates of Britain and Ireland. The kilns consisted of a sunken pit which was then covered over using a wide variety of materials that included sods, wood and in some cases stone. A peat fire would then heat the kernels, causing them to harden; this allowed the tribes to store more grain for longer periods of time and was especially useful through the harsh cold winters. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_agriculture_canal_and_dam_system">Agriculture in the east was often blighted by erratic rainfall in a harsh landscape. Farmers soon realised that irrigation systems, like canals and dams, were ideal for storing and transporting the water they needed for “dry-farming” in these areas. In Mesopotamia, the Euphrates and Tigris rivers were unpredictable and could often swell after sowing season, flooding the crops. Storage basins were therefore used to collect the surplus water, and a canal system was constructed to distribute it as needed to the fields.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_tactics_pike_phalanx">Traditionally, the Greek phalanx attacked en masse in close order. Over time this tactic evolved to take on more complex forms: the Thebans adopted an oblique phalanx formation under the leadership of Epaminondas; this placed the greatest density of troops on the left wing of the phalanx to strike the enemy on their traditionally powerful right. This was used to great effect against the Spartans at the Battle of Leuctra. Epaminondas arranged his troops 50 men deep on the left to take on Sparta’s most experienced and fearsome warriors. This unexpected shift of tactics won him the battle and helped to disprove the myth that Spartan warriors were invincible.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_navy_marine_training">The marines of ancient Greece were paid volunteers who tended to be from the lower citizen classes. This was possibly because they were more likely to be available for naval service because they were not liable for regular hoplite service. Fighting from the deck of a moving ship required skills that could only be developed through experience, so it is likely that the soldiers employed by Greek navies made their living as marines. Despite their low birth, marines were next to the captain in a ship's hierarchy and took part in ceremonies and political discussions. Thucydides even called the marines of one fleet “the best men” to fall in the Peloponnesian War.</string>

A gateway flanked by towers was no longer enough to repel a determined foe. Defensive towers and platforms grew to accommodate not only archers and slingers, but also artillery engines as well. During the siege of Lilybaeum in 274BC, the Carthaginians placed catapults along the length of their walls to fend off the armies of Pyrrhus; his men were forced to abandon the attack by the weight of the defensive artillery bombardment.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_philosophy_cultism">The idea of the “Imperial Cult”, for the worship of Rome in the form of a Roman Emperor, started when Julius Caesar was officially given divine status by the Senate. His adopted son, Augustus, then went on to give himself the title of “Pontifex Maximus”, chief priest of the Roman state, and encouraged the construction of temples in his name. The reverence of a living Emperor was not practised in Rome itself, but throughout the rest of the Empire citizens had an obligation not only to serve the Emperor but also to swear allegiance to him as a figure of worship. This allowed Rome to unify their distant provinces and spread Roman culture.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_engineering_construction_stone_footing">Many of the largest Celtic settlements were constructed overlooking or near to rivers. The Arevaci capital Numantia was constructed overlooking the River Douro; this 20 hectare settlement was inhabited from ancient times but reached the height of its prosperity in the third century BC. It contained both stone and timber buildings, both built on stone foundations. Little of the settlement remains to this day as the Romans systematically destroyed it and sold its occupants into slavery. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_management_remuneration_reforms">The military reforms of Gaius Marius marked a significant change in pay for Roman soldiers. Legionaries did not consider the new annual salary of 100 denari, complimented by payment in land or cash up to 3,000 denarii, suitable payment for 25 years hard service. Veteran troops looked to their consuls, frequently their former generals, for more suitable recompense for their efforts, causing inevitable political unrest and eventually, civil war. Emperor Augustus restored stability in the first century BC and was quick to identify the role that the dissatisfied legions had played in the years of strife. He set up the Aerarium Militare, the Military Treasury, a pot of money initiated by his own funds and topped up by regular citizen tax payments; it provided soldiers with a pension equivalent to 14 years' pay. </string>

Layered tactical manoeuvres could be planned and executed to counter any enemy and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The Roman army undoubtedly set the standard and demonstrated the gains from their disciplined tactics in numerous battles, not least when faced with war elephants at the Battle of Zama in 202BC. Here the Romans effortlessly moved as one to create open lanes in their formation, allowing the rampaging beasts to charge harmlessly through their ranks.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_top_logistics">"An army can live off the land in most places, although deserts are an obvious exception. Foraging parties can take food and animal fodder from locals. Working parties can collect firewood as needed. Petty offenders can be made to dig latrines every night as the army camps. Slingers can find a ready resupply of pebbles as missiles wherever there is a beach or riverbed. What can’t be stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried with the army: arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load; medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable as opposed to just plain miserable. 

Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or tired out. He will not give of his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders."</string>

In military terms, it described a heavily armoured cavalryman. These shock troops were first fielded as part of Darius’ army at Gaugalema in 352BC. Mostly Bactrian and Scythian horsemen, these riders and their mounts required excellent stamina as they were completely enclosed by metal scale armour, and in desert heat too! Cataphract cavalry could use their weight and armour to penetrate an enemy line but were far less agile than regular horsemen."</string>

The perfect angle, the optimum speed and the ability to back-water to disengage once the damage had been dealt: all required precision and timing. The most devastating blow was often delivered to the stern, although broadside impacts were more common and didn’t require as much speed to inflict damage. Skillful crews could sweep in parallel to an enemy, retracting their oars whilst shearing off those of their opponent. This would cripple an enemy ship allowing the attacker to circle and carry out a more precise ramming attack.</string>

The flames were seemingly inexhaustible, and its victims had little hope of putting them out as dousing with water was futile.

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_engineering_construction_advanced_construction_techniques">As building materials became more understood and skills developed amongst architects and builders, new construction techniques became possible. Domes, arches and vaults became regular features in Roman architecture but a true dome was perhaps the pinnacle achievement of architects and builders of the time. They posed complex puzzles when it came to supporting the weight of the structure as it was being built, and it took time and a certain amount of trial and error for architects to perfect the system. The Pantheon in Rome is one of the best examples of a true dome and suggests that by 128AD, architects had mastered the form.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_navy_naval_manoeuvres">By the fifth century BC naval battles were changing, as the ship’s ram became the principle weapon, making artful seamanship and carefully timed manoeuvres the key to success. There were a range of recognised tactics, including the “periplous” - an outflanking manoeuvre - and the “diekplous” - a more complex movement which was also known as “breaking the line”. Here an attacking ship would navigate between two enemy vessels and rely on superior speed and agility to ram the midships or stern of its target. This tactic could be aided by sailing close enough to the enemy to shear off their oars, immobilising them before ramming. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_management_propaganda">Propaganda can be a powerful tool. It can incite the masses to revolt against their leaders, turn a foe into an ally or vilify an entire nation. The Romans, for example, were masters of propaganda and this was especially true of their records regarding Carthage. Once they had successfully wiped Carthage from the map forever they began a campaign to damn their vanquished enemy. Many modern historians believe that the practice of child sacrifice was nowhere near as prolific as writers of the time insisted and other historians believe it never happened at all and was simply a piece of Roman propaganda. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_construction_tax_labour">Taxation becomes futile when a populace are too poor to pay taxes. At such times the poor were forced to work unpaid to help complete civil projects. Such measures were common practice in the ancient world; in Egypt the Pharaoh would be merciless in the taxation of his subjects. Peasants were expected to work several days a month to help maintain roads and canals and to lend their muscle to construction and mining. Some governments could be strict in the extreme when imposing tax labour: in Babylonia, failure to fulfil labour obligations would see a man forfeit his lands. </string>

As one of the first Northern European peoples to develop a saddle, they were able to master the horse and improved their range of movement whilst mounted. These early saddles had four pommels, two positioned to the rear and two that angled out over each thigh.

His military successes against the Persians allowed Greek influence to thrive in the Near East, best illustrated by cities such as Ai Khanum, which boasted a number of Greek-style buildings including a palace, a theatre and a gymnasium. Hellenistic architecture became hugely influential and, after equating local gods to Greek ones, Greek temples became incredibly popular.

Alexander the Great used catapults from his ships when he besieged Tyre in 332BC, and it was the Greeks who built the most formidable floating fortress of the time, the Syracusia. Designed by inventor Archimedes this huge transport vessel was said to be 55 metres in length. It featured a raised fighting deck that housed a giant catapult capable of switching between firing a five metre dart or a 80 kilogramme stone missile. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_top_celtic_field_systems">Celtic field systems are small, square plots of land whose size and shape are often attributed to the fact that they would have been worked by one family. The term ‘Celtic field’ was coined by archaeologist O.G.S Crawford. He came across the distinctive patchwork pattern while examining photographs, taken by the Royal Air Force, of the Salisbury Plain area of Britain. Excavation of these areas revealed that they had been inhabited and worked as farmland since the Early Bronze age. </string>

It allowed them to gain access to goods and resources which their lands were unable to produce. Some of these resources could be gathered through tribute paid to Pharaoh from the regions surrounding Egypt. While not under direct government control, the vassal tribes in these regions were influenced by Egyptian rule and culture and were obliged to honour Pharaoh with regular gifts. These were then presented as rewards to officials, helping to distribute them through the entire Egyptian economy. </string>

With organised mass labour, monuments could be constructed on a vast scale. Egyptian tombs and pyramids are some of the earliest examples of monumental architecture in the ancient world. The Greeks built magnificent temples, triumphal arches and monumental columns, as did the Romans. Such monuments were often erected to honour deities or victorious leaders. In conquered lands, they were an effective way of overawing the subject population and reminding them of their loyalties. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_military_war_exercises_warrior_aristocracy">Early barbarian societies were based on a simple caste system. At the bottom were the farmers and labourers, above them the warriors and at the top of society, the intellectuals. Members of the warrior and intellectual castes were buried in lavish graves with all the items they would need in the Otherworld. It is thanks to this custom that we have been able to learn more about these ancient societies. For example, many of the beautiful weapons found in the graves of warriors were simply a symbol of their position in society rather than a practical weapon. </string>

They were hugely effective against wooden hulls, siege engines and wooden siege rams.

When suspended, the stone would be drawn towards the earth’s magnetic pole and spin to face north. Geologists are still unsure exactly how pieces of magnetite become magnetised but it is widely attributed to the strong magnetic fields that surround lightning bolts. This theory is supported by the fact that magnetised deposits of magnetite tend to be found close to the earth’s surface. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_military_warrior_code_animal_imitation">Barbarian tribes believed fervently in the power of nature, especially that of wild beasts. By wearing wolf, bear or boar skins warriors could channel their power, be it speed, strength or ferocity, in the heat of battle. Having a shared association with a specific animal may also have created a brotherhood amongst warriors, who in effect became a pack. The Germanic tribes were known for their association with wolves and wolf-warriors are even shown fighting as part of the Roman army on Trajan’s column in Rome. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_siege_ammunition_stores">Artillery provided defenders with greater firepower, but created a need to produce and store large amounts of ammunition. Stone balls of varying sizes were stored within fortifications for use when the time came. Excavations in Carthage and the Greek city of Dora provide evidence that large-scale production of ammunition took place in order to prepare for the onset of any siege. Over 5600 artillery balls have been found within the site of Carthage; they predate the Roman attack on the city that burnt it to the ground in 146BC. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_economy_legal_documentation">"Contracts between two parties were far easier to enforce when supported by written legal documents. However, with writing skills far from widespread the ""stipulatio"", a basic contract between two parties, was agreed orally by all parties. This form of agreement was the norm in Rome and it took time for written contracts to be accepted. Greek law, on the other hand, had always been based on the principles of written contracts and their influence gradually encouraged the Romans to bind oral contracts within written terms. "</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_siege_elephant_ram">The war elephant could be a powerful weapon in the field, but when its brute strength was brought to bear during a siege assault, it was devastating. A lone elephant could inflict heavy damage to a unit of infantry or a poorly defended gatehouse, but the Ghaznavids were not satisfied by this and developed an elaborate ramming device that was powered by no less than five elephants. This powerful siege weapon was transported by four beasts while a fifth, controlled by a driver, the ‘mahout’, pushed and pulled the iron tipped ram.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_druidism_sacrificial_rites">As with many aspects of barbarian society, the practice of human sacrifice is still debated by historians. Some argue that bog bodies like the Lindow Man, found in Cheshire, England, are perfect examples of ritual sacrifice. Discovered face down with injuries that suggest he was hit on the head, strangled and had his throat cut, this twenty something high born barbarian certainly met a grisly end. Bog bodies have been discovered across the areas of Europe inhabited by barbarian tribes and all exhibit similar injuries, leading some historians to suggest that peat bogs may have had religious significance. </string>

The Cloaca Maxima became so vital to Rome’s development it was even granted its own deity: Cloacina, Goddess of the sewer.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_management_professional_soldiery">Traditionally, the citizen armies of the ancient world were supplied by a combination of levies and volunteer troops. Often farmers and landowners, these men ultimately looked to return to their plots and families, comforted by the spoils of war. The professional solider was a different beast entirely. He gave his life to the army, never wavering to think on what awaited him back home. However, when a state discharged these men without suitable reward, they often turned to their generals. If successful in finding the spoils to offer his men, a general could exert huge influence and power. In 88BC Sulla was the first aggrieved general to march his men towards Rome, an act which led to many “marches on Rome” led by power hungry generals, followed by strong and powerful armies. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_management_cultural_assimilation">As military tactics developed, so too did the need for specialist troops to use them. This prompted the Pharaoh and his generals to look to captured lands for recruits with useful skills. Egyptian culture dominated Nubia after its re-conquest, and Egyptian gods, hieroglyphs and social structure were imposed. Even so, the skills of the locals were prized and exploited: Nubian archers were recruited in Pharaoh’s armies, and were said to be buried with their bows. Egypt also recruited troops among the Medjay, a nomadic people of lower Nubia. They provided warriors, scouts and the police to guard royal palaces. While distinct, these people were very much part of an Egyptian empire.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_construction_water_sluicing">The ancients discovered that the use of water in mining, especially gold mining, eased extraction and washed ore from hillsides. Two main methods were employed, hushing and ground sluicing. Hushing used large quantities of water, stored in tanks, which were poured down over the deposit. This dislodged sediment, exposed the deposit for easier mining and washed smaller deposits into sluicing boxes where they could be collected. Ground sluicing achieved similar results but was a more controlled technique. Requiring a constant steady flow of water, it often involved the redirection of natural streams and rivers. Both techniques left land stripped back to bedrock.</string>

The Macedonians made many advances in siege craft, including the introduction of the covered battering-ram, the cunning invention of Polyidus of Thessaly who served Philip II of Macedon.</string>

Both Caesar and Strabo wrote of the strength of the warships built by the Veneti tribe, stating that ramming attacks did very little damage to the strong oak hulls, forcing the Romans to develop new tactics to defeat the Veneti. </string>

The “Agoge” training program was the most demanding in the ancient world and bred a hugely efficient and feared fighting force.

Some of the greatest advances made in this area were put forward by a jurist known simply as Gaius. He wrote many great works on the finer points of Roman law but he is best known for his work “The Institutions of Gaius”. It was broken into four sections that discussed how people, things, intestate succession and actions should be governed by law. </string>

The perfect angle, the optimum speed and the ability to back-water to disengage once the damage had been dealt: all required precision and timing. The most devastating blow was often delivered to the stern, although broadside impacts were more common and didn’t require as much speed to inflict damage. Skillful crews could sweep in parallel to an enemy, retracting their oars whilst shearing off those of their opponent. This would cripple an enemy ship allowing the attacker to circle and carry out a more precise ramming attack.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_engineering_construction_temple_design">Architecture, particularly throughout the Greek world, was inspired by temple design. Initially, temple buildings housed the statue of a chosen deity, constructed from wood and clay bricks. They were humble in appearance compared to the stone structures that followed. The early Greek stone temples remained basic, consisting of a “portico” design: a simple covered porch, lined by columns. These gave way to more intricate and opulent layouts, which expanded the number of columns used. The “peripteral” design featured a line of columns, or a “colonnade”, all around the structure. Multi-storey and circular designs were also developed, as were monumental gateways and multiple-entrance temple structures.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_construction_advanced_construction_techniques">As building materials became more understood and skills developed amongst architects and builders, new construction techniques became possible. Domes, arches and vaults became regular features in Roman architecture but a true dome was perhaps the pinnacle achievement of architects and builders of the time. They posed complex puzzles when it came to supporting the weight of the structure as it was being built, and it took time and a certain amount of trial and error for architects to perfect the system. The Pantheon in Rome is one of the best examples of a true dome and suggests that by 128AD, architects had mastered the form.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_farming_souterrain">Souterrains, sometimes known as fougou, were huge pits used by the Celts to store food. For many years archaeologists were baffled as to how vegetables and grain could remain dry in such conditions, but now, thanks to experiments done at Butser Celtic Farm in Hampshire, they have their answer. With the pit sealed contact with the damp walls caused the grain to germinate, using the available oxygen and dispelling carbon dioxide. The rest of the grain would then enter a form of suspended animation, allowing it to remain in perfect condition for months.  </string>

With many of the ruling elite Hellenic in origin, it was common practice to mix both Greek and local customs in religious observances. Rather than enforcing their view, rulers commonly allowed their people and any immigrant settlers to continue their own religious practices. Other empires, such as Parthia, were diverse collections of many kingdoms, each with their own beliefs and cults, encompassing everything from Zoroastrianism to the imperial cult. As long as religion didn't cause disloyalty or late payment of taxes, all was well!</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_navy_naval_manoeuvres">By the fifth century BC naval battles were changing, as the ship’s ram became the principle weapon, making artful seamanship and carefully timed manoeuvres the key to success. There were a range of recognised tactics, including the “periplous” - an outflanking manoeuvre - and the “diekplous” - a more complex movement which was also known as “breaking the line”. Here an attacking ship would navigate between two enemy vessels and rely on superior speed and agility to ram the midships or stern of its target. This tactic could be aided by sailing close enough to the enemy to shear off their oars, immobilising them before ramming. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_economy_animal_husbandry">Breeding and raising livestock was a profitable activity for landowners, requiring far less labour and investment than arable farming. While animals were kept for meat, wool and dairy products for centuries and animal husbandry practised across the ancient world, it was the Romans who truly developed the art. Through selective breeding, the Romans produced bigger, stronger livestock which provided more meat, milk, cheese and wool. They also developed fish farms, to satisfy the demand for fresh fish in inland provinces. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_construction_crane">The Romans adopted the principle of the crane from the Greeks and modified its design to create apparatus capable of lifting huge weights. Some of Rome’s most magnificent buildings undoubtedly benefitted from the use of cranes. The Parthenon, for example, has sections which weigh up to nine tonnes each and that needed to be lifted over nine metres. It is thought that the Romans designed and used two types of crane. The first, the “polyspastos”, had a jib built from two timber beams in an inverted v-shape; the thickness and length of these beams would determine the weight the crane could carry. The second crane type, the “rispastos”, used a single beam jib and could be swung sideways but was not able to bear heavy loads.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_military_warrior_code_infantry_chainmail">Although the Romans often described barbarian warriors as bare chested savages there are classical accounts that clearly discuss their use of chain mail. Appiniaus and Livy both describe “mail clad” Celts fighting in the Battle of Magnesia in 190BC. Archaeologists have also discovered a number of Celtic grave sites containing mail clad warriors, some of which date back as far as the third century BC, making them some of the earliest examples of chainmail in the world.  </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_tactics_strategic_manoeuvres">While battles were traditionally fought on vast, open landscapes, there were exceptions and a clever strategist could use these to his advantage. Terrain was an effective form of defence, with high ground, woods and forests used to protect the rear and flanks of an army, particularly when faced with a highly mobile opponent, well provided with cavalry. Such features could also offer cover for ambush attacks, and knowledge of the terrain became a key factor in the success of the Germans and Gauls who used guerrilla tactics to counter the organised ranks of the Roman army. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_tactics_tactical_flexibility">The heavy phalanx did not disappear from the Hellenistic world overnight, but there was a definite move to compliment it with more flexible and mobile fighting forces, made up of light troops and cavalry. Greek armies began to equip their troops with lighter armour and placed greater emphasis on skirmishing and one-on-one combat. They developed the “thureophoroi” infantryman, a soldier equipped with the oval thureos shield, thought to be modelled on the Roman scutum. More mobile than a hoplite, these men could protect and reinforce the phalanx, attack an enemy from the flanks and generally bridge the gap between the heavy spearman and the light peltast skirmisher. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_tribal_council_cupellation_furnace">Cupellation is the process by which noble metals, such as silver or gold, are extracted from base metals, such as lead or copper. This process takes place under extreme heat and has been in use since the early Bronze Age. The ancient Celtic Smiths were part of the intellectual caste, the highest in barbarian society. Like the druids, they were believed to possess Otherworld knowledge; in their forges they used mysterious techniques involving fire to produce strong metals from ore found deep within the earth. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_siege_improved_defensive_artillery">As armies strengthened their siege engines and developed artillery capable of pummelling settlement walls, defenders were forced to adapt their tactics and equipment to counter the threat. A gateway flanked by towers was no longer enough to repel a determined foe. Defensive towers and platforms grew to accommodate not only archers and slingers, but also artillery engines as well. During the siege of Lilybaeum in 274BC, the Carthaginians placed catapults along the length of their walls to fend off the armies of Pyrrhus; his men were forced to abandon the attack by the weight of the defensive artillery bombardment.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_management_remuneration_reforms">The military reforms of Gaius Marius marked a significant change in pay for Roman soldiers. Legionaries did not consider the new annual salary of 100 denari, complimented by payment in land or cash up to 3,000 denarii, suitable payment for 25 years hard service. Veteran troops looked to their consuls, frequently their former generals, for more suitable recompense for their efforts, causing inevitable political unrest and eventually, civil war. Emperor Augustus restored stability in the first century BC and was quick to identify the role that the dissatisfied legions had played in the years of strife. He set up the Aerarium Militare, the Military Treasury, a pot of money initiated by his own funds and topped up by regular citizen tax payments; it provided soldiers with a pension equivalent to 14 years' pay. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_management_mercenaries">Mercenaries have existed for thousands of years but the earliest written record of them dates back to the seventh century BC, when Greek hoplites sought employment as bodyguards serving Pharaohs and Greek tyrants alike. Mercenaries became a great way to bolster troop numbers during times of war, something the Carthaginians resorted to during their war with Rome. They exploited their trade links to recruit troops from the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic islands. The Romans were more sparing with their use of mercenaries, but acknowledged the shortcomings within the legion, notably archers and cavalry, by making up for the lack with carefully chosen mercenary troops. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_tactics_tactical_drills">As armies adopted flexible forces, subdivided into units, each with their individual function and strengths, tactical drills became the difference between victory and defeat. Layered tactical manoeuvres could be planned and executed to counter any enemy and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The Roman army undoubtedly set the standard and demonstrated the gains from their disciplined tactics in numerous battles, not least when faced with war elephants at the Battle of Zama in 202BC. Here the Romans effortlessly moved as one to create open lanes in their formation, allowing the rampaging beasts to charge harmlessly through their ranks.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_top_foraging">When fighting in foreign lands an army lives or dies on its foraging abilities. The ancient Celts were well aware of this fact and made it incredibly difficult for the Romans to gather food during their invasion. Should a careless General send a small party of men out to forage for food the tribes would make sure those men were never seen again. After losing several parties this way, Caesar started sending entire legions to guard his foragers. </string>

Lined with towers and surrounded by a tributary of the Nile to the east and a moat to the north, which some historians argue may have been filled with crocodiles, the walls of Tharo were near impenetrable.

However, when this was superseded by a more accurate device, the armillary sphere, it found a new function as a surveying tool. It was a portable instrument that could be used to measure distances, angular measurements or work as a level. The dioptra could assess both the horizontal and vertical planes, allowing for readings of the deviation between two set locations, so offering accurate measurement of any angles involved. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_engineering_siege_onager">Roman siege equipment was, with the exception of some specialist pieces, always constructed on campaign. This meant that those who were expected to use the siege equipment needed a good level of engineering knowledge.

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_navy_double_plank_construction">Ship construction in the ancient world developed in response to the perceived need for bigger, stronger vessels. Double planking allowed the ancient shipwrights to build vast, strong hulls whilst keeping the ships light and manoeuvrable. The technique used two types of wood, with the inner layer constructed from a softer material than the exterior. In some cases a layer of lead separated the two woods in vulnerable areas of the ship, while cloth or wool soaked in wax would also be placed between the layers to add waterproofing. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_tactics_pike_phalanx">Traditionally, the Greek phalanx attacked en masse in close order. Over time this tactic evolved to take on more complex forms: the Thebans adopted an oblique phalanx formation under the leadership of Epaminondas; this placed the greatest density of troops on the left wing of the phalanx to strike the enemy on their traditionally powerful right. This was used to great effect against the Spartans at the Battle of Leuctra. Epaminondas arranged his troops 50 men deep on the left to take on Sparta’s most experienced and fearsome warriors. This unexpected shift of tactics won him the battle and helped to disprove the myth that Spartan warriors were invincible.</string>

While Greek architects were slower to embrace new materials and techniques than their Roman counterparts, architecture advanced significantly between 350BC and 100BC.

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_philosophy_foreign_policy">More than military power, although that was often the leverage employed to get agreement, foreign policy in the ancient world encompassed diplomacy, treaties and tributes, the exchange and taking of hostages and prisoners, and trade. However, not everything was done for power, territory or wealth. In 22BC, Phraates IV of Parthia was able to negotiate the return of his son, who had been kidnapped by the usurper Tiridates when he had fled to Rome. In exchange for Phraates’ son, Augustus and the Senate were able to secure the return of the legionary standards that had been lost at the disastrous Battle of Carrhae some 33 years earlier.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_engineering_siege_great_food_vault">Storing large amounts of food became incredibly important as the Romans invaded. Sieges could last for months and starving a population out of their home was a popular Roman tactic. It was employed by Caesar at the Siege of Alesia in 52BC, the battle that ultimately won him the war in Gaul. Conditions became so dire in Alesia that Vercingetorix was forced to eject all the women and children from the city, hoping to save food for the warriors and trusting that the Romans would allow the civilians to flee to safety. However, Caesar issued orders that no exits were to be made in the siege works and the women and children starved to death between the walls of their home and the Roman siege works. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_construction_temple_design">Architecture, particularly throughout the Greek world, was inspired by temple design. Initially, temple buildings housed the statue of a chosen deity, constructed from wood and clay bricks. They were humble in appearance compared to the stone structures that followed. The early Greek stone temples remained basic, consisting of a “portico” design: a simple covered porch, lined by columns. These gave way to more intricate and opulent layouts, which expanded the number of columns used. The “peripteral” design featured a line of columns, or a “colonnade”, all around the structure. Multi-storey and circular designs were also developed, as were monumental gateways and multiple-entrance temple structures.</string>

However, these were heavy and cumbersome machines, requiring large operating crews. Loading and firing took time and left the crew members vulnerable to enemy attacks, particularly from fast-moving cavalry. Placing other units nearby to guard the crew members went some way to protecting them, but arming them and improving their personal armour allowed them to protect themselves.</string>

The “Agoge” training program was the most demanding in the ancient world and bred a hugely efficient and feared fighting force. If a boy survived to the age of 13 he would be subjected to seven years of formal military training until finally, aged 20, he became a man and a true warrior of Sparta. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_management_organised_supply">With armies of increasing size, and campaigns taking troops overseas for months and years, it became vital to maintain supply-lines to keep them provisioned. However, an army’s movement could be severely hampered by its supply train and it was the Greeks who revolutionised military supply and logistics. They disbanded the legion of attendants and wives that trailed behind every army, and introduced the speedier horse and mule to replace the ox-drawn carts. They also made the soldiers carry more. The creation of standardised coinage also allowed states to provide for their armies in enemy territory, because their money could be trusted, with some merchants evolving into the first military contractors. </string>

Foraging parties can take food and animal fodder from locals. Working parties can collect firewood as needed. Petty offenders can be made to dig latrines every night as the army camps. Slingers can find a ready resupply of pebbles as missiles wherever there is a beach or riverbed. What can’t be stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried with the army: arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load; medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable as opposed to just plain miserable. 

Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or tired out. He will not give of his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders."</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_agriculture_seed_selection">The principle of seed selection was simple: sowing the best quality seeds provided the best quality crop. The strength of a crop was affected by the seed from which it was grown and through seed selection a farmer could develop a crop free of disease that offered a more profitable yield. The farmer had to take the time to select only seeds from the most healthy and strong plants in a crop, removing the small, withered, discoloured or inferior seeds. Selecting the seed was usually simple: the best seed was the heaviest, and would therefore be found settled on the very bottom of the grain on the threshing floor.</string>

With improved transport allowing for the movement of grain, it became possible to construct vast storage warehouses to hold a shipped-in food stock. The Romans had an influx of around half-a-million tonnes of food from their harvests which would eventually be dispersed around the city population but this was stored within huge warehouse complexes built at Ostia and just outside Rome. A vast network of warehouses or “horrea” were built along the embankment of the River Tiber in an area known as the Emporium district. </string>

Language skills became almost as valuable as spices. In eastern kingdoms, Aramaic remained the recognised language of trade, but a knowledge of the basics of Greek and Latin became essential as many goods, particularly spices, became sought after commodities in the west.</string>

Taking enemy heads was not, as the Romans believed, a barbaric act perpetrated by blood-crazed madmen but a sign of respect. Enemy heads were washed, embalmed in cedar oil and placed on display to show a warrior’s prowess in battle. They were even used as votive offerings. Many embalmed heads have been discovered in rivers known to be sacred to the ancient Celts. </string>

The storms that racked their lands and the gentle rain that helped to grow their crops were all sent for a reason. It is this deep respect for the natural world that leads many scholars to believe that these tribes would have chosen to worship in the open air, as close to nature as possible. The work of Greek writer Strabo supports this theory, he wrote that the Celts of Galatia met annually at the ‘Drunemeton’ or ‘Oak Sanctuary’ to resolve important religious and political issues.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_military_war_exercises_cavalry_tactics">Roman writers often refused to acknowledge the skills possessed by the barbarians but there was one area of warfare which they freely admitted the Celts exceled at, horsemanship. The Greek historian Strabo stated that the finest cavalry in the whole Roman army were Celts. They were incredibly versatile troops, able to ride to the areas where they were needed and dismount to fight on foot. This was thanks to the cleverly designed bridles worn by their horses; they had a small peg that could be staked in to the ground to keep the horse in place while its rider fought.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_management_mercenaries">Mercenaries have existed for thousands of years but the earliest written record of them dates back to the seventh century BC, when Greek hoplites sought employment as bodyguards serving Pharaohs and Greek tyrants alike. Mercenaries became a great way to bolster troop numbers during times of war, something the Carthaginians resorted to during their war with Rome. They exploited their trade links to recruit troops from the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic islands. The Romans were more sparing with their use of mercenaries, but acknowledged the shortcomings within the legion, notably archers and cavalry, by making up for the lack with carefully chosen mercenary troops. </string>

Such measures prevented prices from escalating as a resource, raw material or luxury item made its way across the ever expanding network of trade routes. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_civil_economy_armed_escorts">Trade between cities promised huge profits. The nomadic tribes, and later merchants, played a vital role in distributing goods and raw materials. Merchants were given great freedom to conduct their activities but, when rivalry between cities escalated to violence, popular and rich trade routes became targets for tribal bandits. Powerful and wealthy individuals exploited such situations, with “caravan-chiefs” selling protection at extortionate rates. It often became necessary for governments to offer armed escorts, ensuring that valuable trade networks remained intact. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_management_naval_artillery_training">Traditionally, artillery in naval warfare was restricted to the use of javelin, slings and archers. It was the Syracusans who made the first steps towards creating artillery pieces that could be used at sea. They designed a contraption known as the “gastraphetes” or the “belly bow”. This oversized composite bow rested on the stomach of its user and was pulled back when braced by the user's feet. It could fire a substantial bolt some 50 yards further than a regular bow. This technology was then scaled up to form the basis of the early “Scorpion”, which eventually evolved into an array of torsion-powered artillery pieces that became commonplace on the decks of ancient ships. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_economy_labour_organisation">Although any citizen or freeman could own land only the very rich could afford to develop it effectively. By investing in a huge labour force these estate owners were able to swallow up smaller, family-run farms and monopolise the market. They employed a seemingly endless supply of landless citizens, ordered into groups and, where possible, closely supervised to ensure that their productivity remained high. Although such workers were often labelled “slave labour”, rations, rewards and even a wage structure were used to incentivise the workers, ensuring that the estates operated efficiently. </string>

Drainage systems ensured that arable plots were not flooded or waterlogged. Despite their climate, the Romans built more drainage ditches around their farmland in Italy than irrigation channels. Farmers had to work to keep these ditches free from blockages. As soon as there was rainfall they would ensure that the drainage channels were clear so that the ditches could collect the surplus water.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_management_military_settlement">For centuries it was deemed unnecessary to pay soldiers, let alone provide them with a pension on retirement. Military service was seen as a privilege, duty and price of citizenship. Soldiers paid their own way, supplying their own weapons and equipment. In order to recruit larger, professional, full-time armies, it became sensible to pay troops and offer land on completion of military service. During the Peloponnesian War, Athens provided their troops with a living allowance which then progressed to full remuneration. Other Greek cities swiftly followed, and the military landscape began its transformation, as armies turned professional rather than being citizen militias.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_management_marine_training">The marines of ancient Greece were paid volunteers who tended to be from the lower citizen classes. This was possibly because they were more likely to be available for naval service because they were not liable for regular hoplite service. Fighting from the deck of a moving ship required skills that could only be developed through experience, so it is likely that the soldiers employed by Greek navies made their living as marines. Despite their low birth, marines were next to the captain in a ship's hierarchy and took part in ceremonies and political discussions. Thucydides even called the marines of one fleet “the best men” to fall in the Peloponnesian War.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_farming_grain_kiln">Grain kilns were used to dry out grain before it could be stored, this was particularly important in the damp climates of Britain and Ireland. The kilns consisted of a sunken pit which was then covered over using a wide variety of materials that included sods, wood and in some cases stone. A peat fire would then heat the kernels, causing them to harden; this allowed the tribes to store more grain for longer periods of time and was especially useful through the harsh cold winters. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_navy_ship_pumps">Wooden ships routinely sprang leaks and the accumulation of water within a large hull had to be bailed out by hand, a slow and sometimes dangerous task. It was a job made easier by the invention of the force pump. The Greek inventor, Cteisibius of Alexandria, developed the theories about compressed air that made this device possible, earning him the soubriquet “the father of pneumatics”. The device was made up of two cylinders, a series of pipes and connected pistons that sucked the water into one cylinder to push it out of the second.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_construction_city_planning">As cities changed and developed, consideration needed to be given to layout and design. Cities began to be built in an ordered fashion, in sectors divided using a common grid system. This formed the basis for the majority of the cities built across the Mediterranean, with the grids divided by fairly narrow thoroughfares. Mostly pedestrian traffic meant there was little need to create bigger routes. Only when the slope or curvature of the land changed, perhaps to accommodate a harbour, would a city plan waver from the established grid network. </string>

Messages tended to be carried by mounted couriers, but the introduction of a system using lights and mirrors extended the possible chain of communication. In battle, signals were often given by musical instruments: the Parthian light horseman carried out their complex ‘Parthian shot’ attack according to signals delivered by tympanon drums.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_philosophy_cultural_assimilation">"The cultures of the Eastern kingdoms were heavily influenced by Greek ways. Hellenism, the spread of Greek culture and ideas, eventually led to the demise of cuneiform writing, the ancient Mesopotamian system of pictographs. Given a choice, people of the East chose to read and write in Greek, as it allowed them to study the works of the great philosophers or pursue a career in politics. Rather than resist this cultural shift, the Eastern kingdoms convinced themselves that Greek ideas were in fact their own, taken from them during Alexander’s campaign in Persia. Their adoption actually marked a return to ""traditional values"". "</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_management_foraging_protection">The Romans employed a number of techniques for protecting their foragers from enemy attacks. Prior to the Battle of Cannae in 216BC consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus set up secondary camps, a mile from the main army, to guard his foragers. Careful protection by accompanying troops was essential and the Romans also deployed large numbers of infantry and cavalry to shadow foraging troops. This protection could sometimes take the form of light auxiliaries for smaller parties, although Caesar often sent a full legion to guard his larger grain-foraging expeditions.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_military_war_exercises_infantry_drills">Although many barbarian tribes favoured ambush and shock tactics there were some who developed techniques that could be used in set-piece battles. The Germanic tribes went into battle in columns and when warriors from different tribes fought together each tribe formed their own column. This not only allowed them to fight in their own styles using their own chants and war dances but created rivalry and encouraged the tribes to prove their prowess in battle to their neighbours. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_tactics_advanced_cavalry_tactics">The horsemen of Parthia, Armenia and Sarmatia were some of the finest in the ancient world. Their complex formations and tactics were so effective that other armies, including the Romans, rushed to copy them. The Cantabrian Circle, a fast-moving cavalry formation, was adopted by the Roman army shortly after the Cantabrian Wars. Riders would form a loose circle, each horse following the next at full gallop and as the riders came round to face the enemy they would loose their arrows. This deadly formation presented a difficult target for enemy archers and provided a constant stream of deadly arrow fire. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_civil_agriculture_double_cropping">With the growing demand for food and good profits to be made from trade, farmers could maximize the efficiency of their land by employing the risky strategy of double-cropping. This doubled the yield from the land with the farmer planting a second crop immediately after the first had gone to market. As well as filling the storehouses, this could enrich the soil if the right combinations were planted, and help to control pests and weeds. However, in order for this technique to work a suitable climate was required: double-cropping was only viable in areas which had lengthy growing seasons. </string>

Through the study of these artefacts and their distinctive patterns, archaeologists have been able to piece together the emergence and expansion of Celtic production. As their contact with Rome and other Mediterranean powers increased so too did their output of tradable commodities. Trade with the Greeks is thought to have inspired the creation of a Celtic coinage system, a system that was in place for 50 years before the Romans started minting their own coins.</string>

The Romans, ever wary of the greed of their merchants, fixed grain prices during shortages and even passed pricing edicts that looked to dictate a fixed value for all goods across the Empire. Emperor Diocletian’s price edit of 301AD laid out a huge list of set prices which, if broken, were punishable by execution for the merchant and the buyer. </string>

The technique used two types of wood, with the inner layer constructed from a softer material than the exterior. In some cases a layer of lead separated the two woods in vulnerable areas of the ship, while cloth or wool soaked in wax would also be placed between the layers to add waterproofing. </string>

Increasing the peasant labour force was the simplest method of getting more from arable farmland, but there was also the option of investing in animal husbandry or leasing plots to tenant farmers to profit from rents.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_engineering_construction_double_wall_construction">The Vindelici tribe constructed their settlement known as Manching close to the Danube River. This walled city enclosed some 380 hectares, it comprised carefully laid out streets and impressive outer walls. These were built of a box structure of criss-cross timbers laid horizontally, the stone walls were then built on either side of the timbers and the centre was filled with rubble and stones, creating very thick, strong walls. When Caesar came across this particular construction technique he called it Murus Gallici, or Gallic Walls.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_construction_crane">The Romans adopted the principle of the crane from the Greeks and modified its design to create apparatus capable of lifting huge weights. Some of Rome’s most magnificent buildings undoubtedly benefitted from the use of cranes. The Parthenon, for example, has sections which weigh up to nine tonnes each and that needed to be lifted over nine metres. It is thought that the Romans designed and used two types of crane. The first, the “polyspastos”, had a jib built from two timber beams in an inverted v-shape; the thickness and length of these beams would determine the weight the crane could carry. The second crane type, the “rispastos”, used a single beam jib and could be swung sideways but was not able to bear heavy loads.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_engineering_siege_boiling_oil">"The passive protection of walls was never enough to keep out attackers. Defenders began experimenting with other ways to repel invading enemy forces, and one such method was the use of boiling oil. The Roman army encountered it at the siege of Jotapata. The historian Josephus described the effect the oil had on the Roman soldiers, ""the oil did easily run down the whole body from head to foot, under their armour, and fed upon their flesh like flame itself."""</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_engineering_construction_water_sluicing">The ancients discovered that the use of water in mining, especially gold mining, eased extraction and washed ore from hillsides. Two main methods were employed, hushing and ground sluicing. Hushing used large quantities of water, stored in tanks, which were poured down over the deposit. This dislodged sediment, exposed the deposit for easier mining and washed smaller deposits into sluicing boxes where they could be collected. Ground sluicing achieved similar results but was a more controlled technique. Requiring a constant steady flow of water, it often involved the redirection of natural streams and rivers. Both techniques left land stripped back to bedrock.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_management_ways_of_horus">Horus, the Egyptian God of Hunting and War, was a powerful deity whose eyes were said to be the Sun and the Moon, watching over the people of Egypt. His weapon was a spear, which was seen as a symbol of security and protection. The dead were buried with replicas of Horus’ spear as a means of protection on their journey to the afterlife. He was also synonymous with the Pharaohs who were considered to be Horus incarnate.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_military_navy_shallow_keel">Barbarian tribes used superior knowledge of their homelands to defeat invading Roman armies on land and at sea. Caesar described how the Veneti had the largest fleet of the Gallic tribes and were masters of navigating the western seas. He also stated that their ships were “made with flatter bottoms, to help them to ride shallow waters caused by shoals or ebb tides.” These shallow keels were perfect for navigating the rocky coastlines, an attribute that Roman ships lacked. </string>

Iron bolts that Caesar described as being “as thick as a man’s thumb” were used to fix timbers and anchors pulled by strong iron chains were used to keep ships in place.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_tactics_flaming_arrows">Flaming arrows were created by tying an oil-soaked cloth beneath the arrowhead to ensure the fire continued to burn in flight. The Romans developed more advanced incendiary arrows that required loosely strung custom bows to prevent the fire from being extinguished when fired. They were hugely effective against wooden hulls, siege engines and wooden siege rams. A shower of fire arrows could scatter even the most disciplined force and cause cavalry and war elephants to run amok.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_military_tactics_physical_conditioning">In Sparta baby boys were examined by elders: those considered too weak were cast from Mount Taygetos; the worthy would face a childhood geared towards conditioning them for the physical demands of war. The “Agoge” training program was the most demanding in the ancient world and bred a hugely efficient and feared fighting force. If a boy survived to the age of 13 he would be subjected to seven years of formal military training until finally, aged 20, he became a man and a true warrior of Sparta. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_siege_improved_defensive_artillery">As armies strengthened their siege engines and developed artillery capable of pummelling settlement walls, defenders were forced to adapt their tactics and equipment to counter the threat. A gateway flanked by towers was no longer enough to repel a determined foe. Defensive towers and platforms grew to accommodate not only archers and slingers, but also artillery engines as well. During the siege of Lilybaeum in 274BC, the Carthaginians placed catapults along the length of their walls to fend off the armies of Pyrrhus; his men were forced to abandon the attack by the weight of the defensive artillery bombardment.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_top_logistics">"An army can live off the land in most places, although deserts are an obvious exception. Foraging parties can take food and animal fodder from locals. Working parties can collect firewood as needed. Petty offenders can be made to dig latrines every night as the army camps. Slingers can find a ready resupply of pebbles as missiles wherever there is a beach or riverbed. What can’t be stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried with the army: arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load; medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable as opposed to just plain miserable. 

Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or tired out. He will not give of his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders."</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_engineering_siege_central_grain_warehouse">As populations grew and the demand for food increased, long-term storage of grain became vital. With improved transport allowing for the movement of grain, it became possible to construct vast storage warehouses to hold a shipped-in food stock. The Romans had an influx of around half-a-million tonnes of food from their harvests which would eventually be dispersed around the city population but this was stored within huge warehouse complexes built at Ostia and just outside Rome. A vast network of warehouses or “horrea” were built along the embankment of the River Tiber in an area known as the Emporium district. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_construction_measuring_instruments">Instruments to measure distance and the slope of the land helped to develop the ancient art and profession of land surveying. It is widely believed that the Egyptians were the first to invent such instruments, although one of the most influential tools, the groma, is said to have come from Mesopotamia. This tool was simple in appearance, a two-metre staff supported a crossed bracket, with a plumb bob hanging from each of the four cross points. It was used to assess lines and angles, and was imported by the Greeks from Mesopotamia and then introduced to the Romans by the Etruscans.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_economy_common_weights_and_measures">"The science of measurement, metrology, was invented by the Egyptians during the Bronze age. Its creation was inspired by a lust for money as Pharaoh Sesostris wanted to measure and tax his subjects' arable land. 

Units of measurement were typically based on parts of the human body or a man’s capacity: the digit, palm, foot and pace for example. Not surprisingly there were many local variations, but as trade between cities and states increased there were attempts to introduce standard quantities of everything. The Greek King Pheidon is widely recognised as the creator of the first set of agreed common weights and measures. "</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_military_warrior_code_infantry_chainmail">Although the Romans often described barbarian warriors as bare chested savages there are classical accounts that clearly discuss their use of chain mail. Appiniaus and Livy both describe “mail clad” Celts fighting in the Battle of Magnesia in 190BC. Archaeologists have also discovered a number of Celtic grave sites containing mail clad warriors, some of which date back as far as the third century BC, making them some of the earliest examples of chainmail in the world.  </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_tribal_council_multilingual">Although barbarian tribes had their own languages, they often used the alphabets of other civilisations for their written records. Early Celtic text, found on a variety of artefacts, used the Etruscan alphabet, however, around the third century BC the use of Greek characters became more prevalent, especially in Gaul. Potters records, graffiti and the Coligny calendar have all been found in areas inhabited by the tribes of Gaul and were all written using the Greek alphabet. </string>

Contracts did exist prior to this point but consensual contracts allowed transactions to take place without property changing hands: there merely needed to be consensus or agreement between the involved parties. There were four types of consensual contract: “emptio-venditio” was a contract for the exchange of goods; “locatio-conductio” was a contract for the hire of goods; while “societas” governed partnerships. The final consensual contract was “mandatum” which dealt with the commissioning of one party to carry out an activity that would benefit another without reward. </string>

As long as a man is tall, the bell of the horn often depicted an animal head; examples of snake, horse and boar heads have been found across Europe. The carnyx produced a long drawn out scream and some historians believe that the Celts deliberately sabotaged them to stop outsiders from playing them. A number of carnyx discovered in France in 2004 were missing a key component in the bell of the horn which prevented them from making their infamous scream.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_management_organised_supply">With armies of increasing size, and campaigns taking troops overseas for months and years, it became vital to maintain supply-lines to keep them provisioned. However, an army’s movement could be severely hampered by its supply train and it was the Greeks who revolutionised military supply and logistics. They disbanded the legion of attendants and wives that trailed behind every army, and introduced the speedier horse and mule to replace the ox-drawn carts. They also made the soldiers carry more. The creation of standardised coinage also allowed states to provide for their armies in enemy territory, because their money could be trusted, with some merchants evolving into the first military contractors. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_druidism_druidic_judgement">Druids were called upon to pass judgement on all disputes, even those between different tribes. They passed judgement on murderers, disputes of inheritance or boundaries and even appointed the compensation to be paid and received. Should an individual refuse to accept druidic judgement they would be banned from taking part in sacrifices, the worst punishment that could be inflicted. They were then treated as outcasts, denied any future justice and excluded from a share of any honour won in battle. </string>

By the fourth century, the ram evolved to feature multiple blades above and below the waterline. The Greeks developed a blunt bronze ram which was designed to smash the enemy hull rather than pierce it, enabling them to attack, break free and watch their stricken foes sink. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_economy_trade_language">As trade networks between countries and regions grew, the language of trade evolved. Merchants were no longer dealing with men from the next town over: vast trade routes like the “Silk Road” linked Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe. Language skills became almost as valuable as spices. In eastern kingdoms, Aramaic remained the recognised language of trade, but a knowledge of the basics of Greek and Latin became essential as many goods, particularly spices, became sought after commodities in the west.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_civil_agriculture_intensified_agriculture">As populations boomed the demand for food increased, driving farmers to use more intensive farming techniques. Technology played its part, with improved tools and the domestication of large animals to pull advanced and effective ploughs. Larger labour forces and the growth of other techniques, such as terraced farming, opened new areas for cultivation. The construction of more complex canals and dams helped to turn arid landscapes into well-irrigated farming plots. </string>

In the 8th century BC, the Greeks discovered that thrush droppings, when spread across a harvested field, could enrich the soil for the next crop. The Romans, concerned about the small amount of land available around the Mediterranean, became careful masters of their farm plots, practising mixed farming. They used “fallowing”, resting the land between harvests, to allow their animal herds to naturally fertilise the soil. The Roman statesmen, Cato the Elder, listed the most effective fertilisers as “...litter from stables, lupine, chaff, beanstalks, and the leaves of oak and holm-oak.” </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_top_engineering">To appreciate the skill of ancient engineers we need simply look at the works they left behind. The Great Pyramid at Giza, the Pantheon and the Coliseum in Rome and the Acropolis in Athens. All of these monuments were constructed in a time before heavy mechanical aids and they have stood the test of time. Some, like the Great Pyramid, have left historians slightly baffled as to how they were constructed whereas others give real insight into the civilisations that constructed them. The ceiling of the Pantheon, for example, shows Rome’s mastery of concrete and moulds to develop its complex and beautiful architecture.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_engineering_construction_under_floor_drainage">For many years it was thought that the Romans were the only people in Europe to develop under floor drainage. However, the settlement of Chysauster in Madron, Cornwall proves that the Celts also developed this technology. Chysauster is one of the best preserved early Celtic stone villages; it was constructed before the Roman invasion of Britain and continued to be inhabited until the 4th century AD. Out of the nine oval houses found in the village only one had under floor drainage, which may indicate that it was a symbol of prestige. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_civil_philosophy_military_mint">Carthage relied heavily on mercenaries to bolster its citizen armies, a strategy that worked well for short campaigns close to home. However, when campaigns lasted longer than anticipated and coin was not forthcoming, mercenaries became less than trustworthy. In 240BC a group of mercenaries who had fought for Carthage during the First Punic War seized Tunis because they weren't paid. To help prevent this situation from ever arising again the Carthaginians began minting coins on campaign. They were made from silver, gold and electrum and were marked “from the camp”.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_civil_farming_iron_tools">The introduction of iron as a material for traditional farming tools, particularly the plough, improved the efficiency of farming and allowed farmers to meet a growing demand for crops. The basic plough was known as the “ard” and was a simple soil-breaking tool pulled by animals, normally oxen. By introducing an iron ploughshare to the point of the ard, the tool became far more effective; it was able to dig deeper grooves in the soil and wore out less frequently. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_construction_city_planning">As cities changed and developed, consideration needed to be given to layout and design. Cities began to be built in an ordered fashion, in sectors divided using a common grid system. This formed the basis for the majority of the cities built across the Mediterranean, with the grids divided by fairly narrow thoroughfares. Mostly pedestrian traffic meant there was little need to create bigger routes. Only when the slope or curvature of the land changed, perhaps to accommodate a harbour, would a city plan waver from the established grid network. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_management_propaganda">Propaganda can be a powerful tool. It can incite the masses to revolt against their leaders, turn a foe into an ally or vilify an entire nation. The Romans, for example, were masters of propaganda and this was especially true of their records regarding Carthage. Once they had successfully wiped Carthage from the map forever they began a campaign to damn their vanquished enemy. Many modern historians believe that the practice of child sacrifice was nowhere near as prolific as writers of the time insisted and other historians believe it never happened at all and was simply a piece of Roman propaganda. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_civil_economy_labour_organisation">Although any citizen or freeman could own land only the very rich could afford to develop it effectively. By investing in a huge labour force these estate owners were able to swallow up smaller, family-run farms and monopolise the market. They employed a seemingly endless supply of landless citizens, ordered into groups and, where possible, closely supervised to ensure that their productivity remained high. Although such workers were often labelled “slave labour”, rations, rewards and even a wage structure were used to incentivise the workers, ensuring that the estates operated efficiently. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_engineering_siege_onager">Roman siege equipment was, with the exception of some specialist pieces, always constructed on campaign.

The armies of the Mediterranean paid handsomely to harness their power and considerable profit could be made from their passage from Asian seaports.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_civil_agriculture_land_drainage">While arable land required ample irrigation, particularly when subjected to the hot Mediterranean climate, too much surface water collected from natural run-off could also wash goodness from the land. Drainage systems ensured that arable plots were not flooded or waterlogged. Despite their climate, the Romans built more drainage ditches around their farmland in Italy than irrigation channels. Farmers had to work to keep these ditches free from blockages. As soon as there was rainfall they would ensure that the drainage channels were clear so that the ditches could collect the surplus water.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_farming_land_reclamation">Throughout the ancient world there was a drive to find new exploitable land, either through clearing forests or, more frequently, draining lakes, marshes and flooded plains. The Greeks set their sights on draining Lake Copais, a swampland north of Athens that was flooding fertile land around it as the natural flow of water was blocked due to regular earthquakes. In 325BC an engineer, Crates, sought to solve the problem by supplementing the natural drainage in the area with a long tunnel. The work was halted by the military ambitions of Alexander the Great but resumed centuries later. In 1890 the lake was finally drained and the area is now used for farming.</string>

Mercenaries became a great way to bolster troop numbers during times of war, something the Carthaginians resorted to during their war with Rome. They exploited their trade links to recruit troops from the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic islands. The Romans were more sparing with their use of mercenaries, but acknowledged the shortcomings within the legion, notably archers and cavalry, by making up for the lack with carefully chosen mercenary troops. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_civil_economy_intensified_agriculture">As populations boomed the demand for food increased, driving farmers to use more intensive farming techniques. Technology played its part, with improved tools and the domestication of large animals to pull advanced and effective ploughs. Larger labour forces and the growth of other techniques, such as terraced farming, opened new areas for cultivation. The construction of more complex canals and dams helped to turn arid landscapes into well-irrigated farming plots. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_economy_land_reclamation">Throughout the ancient world there was a drive to find new exploitable land, either through clearing forests or, more frequently, draining lakes, marshes and flooded plains. The Greeks set their sights on draining Lake Copais, a swampland north of Athens that was flooding fertile land around it as the natural flow of water was blocked due to regular earthquakes. In 325BC an engineer, Crates, sought to solve the problem by supplementing the natural drainage in the area with a long tunnel. The work was halted by the military ambitions of Alexander the Great but resumed centuries later. In 1890 the lake was finally drained and the area is now used for farming.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_management_naval_manoeuvres">By the fifth century BC naval battles were changing, as the ship’s ram became the principle weapon, making artful seamanship and carefully timed manoeuvres the key to success. There were a range of recognised tactics, including the “periplous” - an outflanking manoeuvre - and the “diekplous” - a more complex movement which was also known as “breaking the line”. Here an attacking ship would navigate between two enemy vessels and rely on superior speed and agility to ram the midships or stern of its target. This tactic could be aided by sailing close enough to the enemy to shear off their oars, immobilising them before ramming. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_management_land_grant">The Egyptians were blessed with conditions that granted them exceptional arable land, annually revitalised by the flooding of the Nile. While a village economy initially provided the basis for landowning in Egypt, the government eventually seized control of land and created large royal estates. Owning land became prestigious, and reserved for the privileged and powerful. By the New Kingdom period, between 1550BC and 1069BC, the Pharaohs began to give land in recognition for military service, and veterans became established contributors to the agricultural economy, often using local slaves to work their holdings. </string>

The storms that racked their lands and the gentle rain that helped to grow their crops were all sent for a reason. It is this deep respect for the natural world that leads many scholars to believe that these tribes would have chosen to worship in the open air, as close to nature as possible. The work of Greek writer Strabo supports this theory, he wrote that the Celts of Galatia met annually at the ‘Drunemeton’ or ‘Oak Sanctuary’ to resolve important religious and political issues.</string>

Pontus, on the Black Sea and reliant on sea trade, required a strong navy to protect its interests. Developed from the Greek trireme, ships were improved by adding more banks of rowers. Ships also got bigger, and increased in both length and beam, but at a cost in speed; this allowed larger marine contingents to be carried. Quinqueremes were common from the 4th Century BC and featuring rows of five oarsmen, but in the east colossal ""20s"" and ""40s"" were constructed.

While Greek architects were slower to embrace new materials and techniques than their Roman counterparts, architecture advanced significantly between 350BC and 100BC. The three traditional columnar orders – Doric, Ionic and Corinthian - were all adapted to allow for the construction of a variety of new buildings.

Their complex formations and tactics were so effective that other armies, including the Romans, rushed to copy them. The Cantabrian Circle, a fast-moving cavalry formation, was adopted by the Roman army shortly after the Cantabrian Wars. Riders would form a loose circle, each horse following the next at full gallop and as the riders came round to face the enemy they would loose their arrows. This deadly formation presented a difficult target for enemy archers and provided a constant stream of deadly arrow fire. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_agriculture_double_cropping">With the growing demand for food and good profits to be made from trade, farmers could maximize the efficiency of their land by employing the risky strategy of double-cropping. This doubled the yield from the land with the farmer planting a second crop immediately after the first had gone to market. As well as filling the storehouses, this could enrich the soil if the right combinations were planted, and help to control pests and weeds. However, in order for this technique to work a suitable climate was required: double-cropping was only viable in areas which had lengthy growing seasons. </string>

It is widely believed that the Egyptians were the first to invent such instruments, although one of the most influential tools, the groma, is said to have come from Mesopotamia. This tool was simple in appearance, a two-metre staff supported a crossed bracket, with a plumb bob hanging from each of the four cross points. It was used to assess lines and angles, and was imported by the Greeks from Mesopotamia and then introduced to the Romans by the Etruscans.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_german_military_warrior_code_war_horn">War horns were designed to intimidate the enemy and came in many shapes and sizes, but perhaps the most interesting was the Celtic carnyx. As long as a man is tall, the bell of the horn often depicted an animal head; examples of snake, horse and boar heads have been found across Europe. The carnyx produced a long drawn out scream and some historians believe that the Celts deliberately sabotaged them to stop outsiders from playing them. A number of carnyx discovered in France in 2004 were missing a key component in the bell of the horn which prevented them from making their infamous scream.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_military_tactics_strategic_manoeuvres">While battles were traditionally fought on vast, open landscapes, there were exceptions and a clever strategist could use these to his advantage. Terrain was an effective form of defence, with high ground, woods and forests used to protect the rear and flanks of an army, particularly when faced with a highly mobile opponent, well provided with cavalry. Such features could also offer cover for ambush attacks, and knowledge of the terrain became a key factor in the success of the Germans and Gauls who used guerrilla tactics to counter the organised ranks of the Roman army. </string>

Greek armies began to equip their troops with lighter armour and placed greater emphasis on skirmishing and one-on-one combat. They developed the “thureophoroi” infantryman, a soldier equipped with the oval thureos shield, thought to be modelled on the Roman scutum. More mobile than a hoplite, these men could protect and reinforce the phalanx, attack an enemy from the flanks and generally bridge the gap between the heavy spearman and the light peltast skirmisher. </string>

Chysauster is one of the best preserved early Celtic stone villages; it was constructed before the Roman invasion of Britain and continued to be inhabited until the 4th century AD. Out of the nine oval houses found in the village only one had under floor drainage, which may indicate that it was a symbol of prestige. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_navy_improved_artillery">Traditionally, artillery in naval warfare was restricted to the use of javelin, slings and archers. It was the Syracusans who made the first steps towards creating artillery pieces that could be used at sea. They designed a contraption known as the “gastraphetes” or the “belly bow”. This oversized composite bow rested on the stomach of its user and was pulled back when braced by the user's feet. It could fire a substantial bolt some 50 yards further than a regular bow. This technology was then scaled up to form the basis of the early “Scorpion”, which eventually evolved into an array of torsion-powered artillery pieces that became commonplace on the decks of ancient ships. </string>

The Romans had an influx of around half-a-million tonnes of food from their harvests which would eventually be dispersed around the city population but this was stored within huge warehouse complexes built at Ostia and just outside Rome. A vast network of warehouses or “horrea” were built along the embankment of the River Tiber in an area known as the Emporium district. </string>

The “Agoge” training program was the most demanding in the ancient world and bred a hugely efficient and feared fighting force. If a boy survived to the age of 13 he would be subjected to seven years of formal military training until finally, aged 20, he became a man and a true warrior of Sparta. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_management_advanced_chariot_training">The war chariot had its roots in Mesopotamia, in modern day Iraq. The early two-wheeled version required little expertise to master, but as the potential of the chariot as a weapon of war was realised, the skill of the charioteer became more important. Virtually all nations of the region used chariots as mobile missile platforms. With their speed, they were effective against slow-moving infantry and ideal for chasing down fleeing enemies.</string>

Mousa Broch on the Shetland Islands has survived the harsh weather conditions and is the tallest surviving example of a broch in the world.

Some of Rome’s most magnificent buildings undoubtedly benefitted from the use of cranes. The Parthenon, for example, has sections which weigh up to nine tonnes each and that needed to be lifted over nine metres. It is thought that the Romans designed and used two types of crane. The first, the “polyspastos”, had a jib built from two timber beams in an inverted v-shape; the thickness and length of these beams would determine the weight the crane could carry. The second crane type, the “rispastos”, used a single beam jib and could be swung sideways but was not able to bear heavy loads.</string>

However, these were heavy and cumbersome machines, requiring large operating crews. Loading and firing took time and left the crew members vulnerable to enemy attacks, particularly from fast-moving cavalry. Placing other units nearby to guard the crew members went some way to protecting them, but arming them and improving their personal armour allowed them to protect themselves.</string>

Perennial irrigation was rarer, and required longer canal systems, a method of storage and better maintenance to ensure that silt and salt build-up was kept in check. In Mesopotamia, the river system was able to supply water to the surrounding arable land in the dry season through a system of canals, closed off by dykes and sluice gates. Water was stored in reservoirs, either natural or man-made, and then lifted into the irrigation channels. While this was a labour-intensive task, the results of such toil were remarkable and hugely beneficial to harvests in the area.</string>

Each tribe had its own songs and dances, the Celts were known for advancing into battle with a rhythmic step, clashing their shields and shouting the name of their tribe. The Germanic tribes danced for a number of reasons including; honouring their dead, to hail a speech, to gloat over a captured banner or simply to celebrate a victory.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_navy_ram">Rams were present on ships as early as the 8th Century BC. Early Phoenician ships had pointed rams that were sheathed in bronze and positioned under the waterline. This type of ram often saw the attacker impaled in its victim and unable to break free. By the fourth century, the ram evolved to feature multiple blades above and below the waterline. The Greeks developed a blunt bronze ram which was designed to smash the enemy hull rather than pierce it, enabling them to attack, break free and watch their stricken foes sink. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_farming_iron_tools">The introduction of iron as a material for traditional farming tools, particularly the plough, improved the efficiency of farming and allowed farmers to meet a growing demand for crops. The basic plough was known as the “ard” and was a simple soil-breaking tool pulled by animals, normally oxen. By introducing an iron ploughshare to the point of the ard, the tool became far more effective; it was able to dig deeper grooves in the soil and wore out less frequently. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_economy_labour_organisation">Although any citizen or freeman could own land only the very rich could afford to develop it effectively. By investing in a huge labour force these estate owners were able to swallow up smaller, family-run farms and monopolise the market. They employed a seemingly endless supply of landless citizens, ordered into groups and, where possible, closely supervised to ensure that their productivity remained high. Although such workers were often labelled “slave labour”, rations, rewards and even a wage structure were used to incentivise the workers, ensuring that the estates operated efficiently. </string>

However, when campaigns lasted longer than anticipated and coin was not forthcoming, mercenaries became less than trustworthy. In 240BC a group of mercenaries who had fought for Carthage during the First Punic War seized Tunis because they weren't paid. To help prevent this situation from ever arising again the Carthaginians began minting coins on campaign. They were made from silver, gold and electrum and were marked “from the camp”.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_engineering_construction_water_sluicing">The ancients discovered that the use of water in mining, especially gold mining, eased extraction and washed ore from hillsides. Two main methods were employed, hushing and ground sluicing. Hushing used large quantities of water, stored in tanks, which were poured down over the deposit.

Hellenism, the spread of Greek culture and ideas, eventually led to the demise of cuneiform writing, the ancient Mesopotamian system of pictographs. Given a choice, people of the East chose to read and write in Greek, as it allowed them to study the works of the great philosophers or pursue a career in politics. Rather than resist this cultural shift, the Eastern kingdoms convinced themselves that Greek ideas were in fact their own, taken from them during Alexander’s campaign in Persia. Their adoption actually marked a return to ""traditional values"". "</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_navy_lode_stone">A lode stone was a navigational device created using a naturally magnetised piece of magnetite. When suspended, the stone would be drawn towards the earth’s magnetic pole and spin to face north. Geologists are still unsure exactly how pieces of magnetite become magnetised but it is widely attributed to the strong magnetic fields that surround lightning bolts. This theory is supported by the fact that magnetised deposits of magnetite tend to be found close to the earth’s surface. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_siege_ammunition_stores">Artillery provided defenders with greater firepower, but created a need to produce and store large amounts of ammunition. Stone balls of varying sizes were stored within fortifications for use when the time came. Excavations in Carthage and the Greek city of Dora provide evidence that large-scale production of ammunition took place in order to prepare for the onset of any siege. Over 5600 artillery balls have been found within the site of Carthage; they predate the Roman attack on the city that burnt it to the ground in 146BC. </string>

The “Agoge” training program was the most demanding in the ancient world and bred a hugely efficient and feared fighting force. If a boy survived to the age of 13 he would be subjected to seven years of formal military training until finally, aged 20, he became a man and a true warrior of Sparta. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_civil_philosophy_intellectual_headhunting">The Ptolemies were keen to encourage Greek immigration into Egypt, tempting military settlers with land grants.

Great philosophers, inventors and educators shared their teachings, research and scientific endeavours with the Egyptian people, and helped to foster a love of knowledge that would see Alexandria as home to the greatest library in the ancient world. </string>

As the river burst its banks the flooding, or “inundation”, irrigated farmland and renewed the fertility of the soil. Together with the lunar cycle, this mostly-predictable “inundation” provided the basis for the Nile calendar. The calendar was divided into three seasons, each with four months of 30 days each. Slowly, the calendar fell out of step with the seasons until the date of the inundation began to fall within a calendar period of drought. This inaccuracy was eventually corrected with the introduction of the leap year during the later Roman period. </string>

Taking enemy heads was not, as the Romans believed, a barbaric act perpetrated by blood-crazed madmen but a sign of respect. Enemy heads were washed, embalmed in cedar oil and placed on display to show a warrior’s prowess in battle. They were even used as votive offerings. Many embalmed heads have been discovered in rivers known to be sacred to the ancient Celts. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_tactics_rapid_advance">The Romans drilled their troops to stay together when marching: stragglers would cause disorder and leave the legion vulnerable. Speed was of the essence, so legionaries were sent on 20-mile marches which were to be completed in five hours at “military step” or 24 miles in the same period of time to train “full step”. Aside from his weapons and armour, every legionary would march with rations, tools and camping equipment to get him used to campaign life as well as build stamina and strength.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_tactics_gymnasia">The Gymnasium was built to provide a place for young Greeks to train themselves for military service. They started out as sparse, open-air venues, on the outskirts of cities, and went on to become huge building complexes at the heart of the community. Wrestling was a popular pursuit, as was pankration, a particularly brutal form of boxing. Proceedings within the gymnasia were overseen by the gymnasiarch. It was his responsibility to procure the olive oil that coated the athletes and ensure that sporting standards were kept up, whilst seeing that those who bent the rules were duly punished. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_military_warrior_code_tribal_totem">Animal totems played an important role in barbarian myths and legends. Many, like the pig or the serpent, were links between our world and the Otherworld. Some were seen as omens, a white stag for example was a sign of the ‘wild hunt’ a group of ghostly hunters who rode through the sky looking for the spirits of the recently deceased. Others, like the bear, the boar and the bull, were worshipped for their strength and power and featured heavily in weapon and shield design. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_civil_economy_land_tax">Taxing the land, or rather the the harvest of the land, was one of the most common and efficient ways a government could employ to gather wealth from its people. Typically, land tax was calculated according to the size of owner's estate. Controversially, the tax could be applied prior to the harvest meaning that, should drought or flood rob the farmer of his crop, he would still be expected to pay his taxes based on the yield he should have gained from the land.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_management_cohort_organisation">"General Gaius Marius introduced radical reforms which changed how the Roman army was recruited and structured and how it fought in battle. The legion’s manipular organisation was scrapped with the “cohort” becoming the basic unit. A legion consisted of ten cohorts of 480 men each rather than 30 maniples; each cohort was divided into six centuries of 80 men. This was later raised to a nominal ""on-paper"" strength of 600, with each century having 100 men; casualties meant that this was rarely the case in practice. Marius also reformed the weaponry and fighting methods of the Roman army. Every man was equipped identically, with the spears of the triarii disposed of, to be replaced by shield, pilum-style javelins and the gladius."</string>

Land became the favoured form of investment as the big estate owners looked to manage their estates carefully to maximise production and profit. Increasing the peasant labour force was the simplest method of getting more from arable farmland, but there was also the option of investing in animal husbandry or leasing plots to tenant farmers to profit from rents.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_siege_battering_ram">Battering rams in their simplest form have existed for millennia. Some clever individual discovered that running a large log at gates seemed to be an effective way of knocking them down.

The Romans had an influx of around half-a-million tonnes of food from their harvests which would eventually be dispersed around the city population but this was stored within huge warehouse complexes built at Ostia and just outside Rome. A vast network of warehouses or “horrea” were built along the embankment of the River Tiber in an area known as the Emporium district. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_navy_improved_ramming">It took an experienced crew to orchestrate an effective ramming attack. The perfect angle, the optimum speed and the ability to back-water to disengage once the damage had been dealt: all required precision and timing. The most devastating blow was often delivered to the stern, although broadside impacts were more common and didn’t require as much speed to inflict damage. Skillful crews could sweep in parallel to an enemy, retracting their oars whilst shearing off those of their opponent. This would cripple an enemy ship allowing the attacker to circle and carry out a more precise ramming attack.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_farming_souterrain">Souterrains, sometimes known as fougou, were huge pits used by the Celts to store food. For many years archaeologists were baffled as to how vegetables and grain could remain dry in such conditions, but now, thanks to experiments done at Butser Celtic Farm in Hampshire, they have their answer. With the pit sealed contact with the damp walls caused the grain to germinate, using the available oxygen and dispelling carbon dioxide. The rest of the grain would then enter a form of suspended animation, allowing it to remain in perfect condition for months.  </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_greek_engineering_construction_water_sluicing">The ancients discovered that the use of water in mining, especially gold mining, eased extraction and washed ore from hillsides. Two main methods were employed, hushing and ground sluicing. Hushing used large quantities of water, stored in tanks, which were poured down over the deposit. This dislodged sediment, exposed the deposit for easier mining and washed smaller deposits into sluicing boxes where they could be collected. Ground sluicing achieved similar results but was a more controlled technique. Requiring a constant steady flow of water, it often involved the redirection of natural streams and rivers. Both techniques left land stripped back to bedrock.</string>

Their complex formations and tactics were so effective that other armies, including the Romans, rushed to copy them. The Cantabrian Circle, a fast-moving cavalry formation, was adopted by the Roman army shortly after the Cantabrian Wars. Riders would form a loose circle, each horse following the next at full gallop and as the riders came round to face the enemy they would loose their arrows. This deadly formation presented a difficult target for enemy archers and provided a constant stream of deadly arrow fire. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_civil_agriculture_double_cropping">With the growing demand for food and good profits to be made from trade, farmers could maximize the efficiency of their land by employing the risky strategy of double-cropping. This doubled the yield from the land with the farmer planting a second crop immediately after the first had gone to market. As well as filling the storehouses, this could enrich the soil if the right combinations were planted, and help to control pests and weeds. However, in order for this technique to work a suitable climate was required: double-cropping was only viable in areas which had lengthy growing seasons. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_siege_siege_tower">Siege towers were huge feats of engineering, sometimes reaching six storeys in height. Any defenders seeing one approaching would instantly do all in their power to halt the tower's advance. Flaming arrows and boiling oil were obvious choices, which allowed the Romans to develop defensive countermeasures for towers. Wet cow skins were often fixed to the frame and men were stationed inside the tower equipped with water hoses made of pickled cow intestines to put out fires.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_civil_druidism_druidic_doctrine">Druids acted as knowledge keepers in many barbarian societies. Afraid their secrets may pass into the wrong hands they never wrote anything down and information was passed verbally.  Stories were passed down from generation to generation in poetry, song and dance. Classical sources, including Strabo and Caesar, suggested that it could take up to twenty years for a druid to learn everything they were expected to know. This was not limited to folktales and rituals, druids were also expected to memorize long and complex law codes and pass judgement on legal cases.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_war_exercises_cavalry_tactics">Roman writers often refused to acknowledge the skills possessed by the barbarians but there was one area of warfare which they freely admitted the Celts exceled at, horsemanship. The Greek historian Strabo stated that the finest cavalry in the whole Roman army were Celts. They were incredibly versatile troops, able to ride to the areas where they were needed and dismount to fight on foot. This was thanks to the cleverly designed bridles worn by their horses; they had a small peg that could be staked in to the ground to keep the horse in place while its rider fought.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_warrior_code_improved_chariots">The Briton’s knowledge of working iron helped them to craft the war chariots that so impressed the Roman invaders. The wheels were wrapped in iron tyre that was purposefully made just a little too small. The wheelwrights would then heat the iron making it expand. When it was placed around the rim and cooled it shrank, and bound the wheel’s components together. This was then further fixed to the wheel with large-headed nails that gave extra grip to the iron tire. </string>

Its mechanism consisted of two thick sinew ropes that twisted as the twin arms of the weapon were drawn back by iron levers. Much research went into the construction of the device, with Egyptian engineers from the city of Alexandria researching the exact component dimensions required to optimise its performance for range and accuracy. When mounted on a fast-moving chariot and manned by a skilled crew, the Scorpion could travel the battlefield at pace, wreaking havoc.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_civil_philosophy_religious_conformity">Like many civilisations, the Carthaginians believed in a pantheon of gods and goddesses. Chief amongst the gods were the God Ba’al Hammon and the Goddess Tanit. If we are to believe writers of the time, these deities demanded regular child sacrifices: nothing else could slake their dark appetites and guarantee their favour to the people of Carthage. Nobles were expected to offer their own children to satisfy the hunger of Ba’al Hammon and Tanit. Anything less would be have been an affront to the gods.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_navy_naval_manoeuvres">By the fifth century BC naval battles were changing, as the ship’s ram became the principle weapon, making artful seamanship and carefully timed manoeuvres the key to success. There were a range of recognised tactics, including the “periplous” - an outflanking manoeuvre - and the “diekplous” - a more complex movement which was also known as “breaking the line”. Here an attacking ship would navigate between two enemy vessels and rely on superior speed and agility to ram the midships or stern of its target. This tactic could be aided by sailing close enough to the enemy to shear off their oars, immobilising them before ramming. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_engineering_construction_tax_labour">Taxation becomes futile when a populace are too poor to pay taxes. At such times the poor were forced to work unpaid to help complete civil projects. Such measures were common practice in the ancient world; in Egypt the Pharaoh would be merciless in the taxation of his subjects. Peasants were expected to work several days a month to help maintain roads and canals and to lend their muscle to construction and mining. Some governments could be strict in the extreme when imposing tax labour: in Babylonia, failure to fulfil labour obligations would see a man forfeit his lands. </string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_carthage_civil_agriculture_improved_irrigation">In its most basic form, irrigation takes water from an available natural source and diverts it to crops through man-made channels or ponds. The Egyptians had little need for such methods thanks to the River Nile which naturally flooded their farmlands every year. The Egyptians perfected systems that diverted the flooding of the Nile to irrigate their crops and deposit the river’s nutrient-rich silt. For those less fortunate, engineering offered the opportunity to improve on primitive methods. The most effective early techniques involved the building of diversion dams that could channel water from a river or stream into a canal.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_briton_military_war_exercises_infantry_drills">Although many barbarian tribes favoured ambush and shock tactics there were some who developed techniques that could be used in set-piece battles. The Germanic tribes went into battle in columns and when warriors from different tribes fought together each tribe formed their own column. This not only allowed them to fight in their own styles using their own chants and war dances but created rivalry and encouraged the tribes to prove their prowess in battle to their neighbours. </string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_top_logistics">"An army can live off the land in most places, although deserts are an obvious exception. Foraging parties can take food and animal fodder from locals. Working parties can collect firewood as needed. Petty offenders can be made to dig latrines every night as the army camps. Slingers can find a ready resupply of pebbles as missiles wherever there is a beach or riverbed. What can’t be stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried with the army: arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load; medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable as opposed to just plain miserable. 

Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or tired out. He will not give of his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders."</string>

Nations with hoplite-heavy armies believed dancing and athletics were sufficient to prepare a man for battle. Roman generals took a slightly different view. Legionaries trained with a wooden sword, twice the weight of a battle weapon, against a wooden post. They would train for hours, practising stabs, thrusts and feints against their immobile opponent. This would then progress to fencing practice with other recruits, using swords with covered tips, before the legionary would take his honed weapon skills into full mock battles.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_siege_helepolis">Invented by the Greek engineer Polyidus of Thessaly, the Helepolis or “city taker” was the biggest siege engine ever constructed. King Demetrius I of Macedon commissioned the architect Epimachus of Athens to build the biggest recorded Helepolis, which he used in the failed siege of Rhodes in 305BC. This huge construction was said to be nearly 40m tall, split into nine storeys, with catapults at its base and two stairways giving access to its multiple levels. Built entirely of wood, it was covered with iron plates to protect it from fire. During the siege the Rhodians managed to dislodge some of these plates, prompting Demetrius to withdraw the weapon for fear of its destruction.</string>
<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_construction_crane">The Romans adopted the principle of the crane from the Greeks and modified its design to create apparatus capable of lifting huge weights. Some of Rome’s most magnificent buildings undoubtedly benefitted from the use of cranes. The Parthenon, for example, has sections which weigh up to nine tonnes each and that needed to be lifted over nine metres. It is thought that the Romans designed and used two types of crane. The first, the “polyspastos”, had a jib built from two timber beams in an inverted v-shape; the thickness and length of these beams would determine the weight the crane could carry. The second crane type, the “rispastos”, used a single beam jib and could be swung sideways but was not able to bear heavy loads.</string>

In Mesopotamia, the river system was able to supply water to the surrounding arable land in the dry season through a system of canals, closed off by dykes and sluice gates. Water was stored in reservoirs, either natural or man-made, and then lifted into the irrigation channels. While this was a labour-intensive task, the results of such toil were remarkable and hugely beneficial to harvests in the area.</string>

<string name="technologies_long_description_rom_gaul_civil_tribal_council_cupellation_furnace">Cupellation is the process by which noble metals, such as silver or gold, are extracted from base metals, such as lead or copper. This process takes place under extreme heat and has been in use since the early Bronze Age. The ancient Celtic Smiths were part of the intellectual caste, the highest in barbarian society. Like the druids, they were believed to possess Otherworld knowledge; in their forges they used mysterious techniques involving fire to produce strong metals from ore found deep within the earth. </string>
