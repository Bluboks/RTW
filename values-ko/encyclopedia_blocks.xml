<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_characters_abilities_generals">The general has a huge influence on his army’s fortunes in battle, not least because the abilities at his disposal can turn the tide in their favour. Each faction can unlock generals’ abilities and develop them in-line with skills and experience, sometimes upgrading them to become stronger or affect more units. There are two main types: powerful lingering abilities like “The Fear”, which can be used only a handful of times due to its longer cooldown time, and short impact boosts like “War Cry” that pass quickly but can be used many times. As a general or admiral improves each of his three attributes, he will progressively unlock further abilities.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_controls">Basic Controls</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_controls_compass">The manoeuvre compass is used for fine-tuning orders on the battlefield. The three arrows within its top half can be used to direct a unit or group straight ahead, or turn left or right. The button in the centre of the lower half causes the selected unit to step backwards. Holding down this button will make them turn and walk backwards. Clicking and holding down the rank and file buttons on either side change the depth of a unit's formation by increasing or decreasing the number of rows the troops stand in.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_demolish">Buildings can be demolished if you want to construct something else in their place (or leave nothing of value to an invader if you are about to lose a region to them) by use of the demolish button that appears when you mouse over a building on the settlement panel. Settlements and ports cannot be demolished at their base levels.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_politics_power">Influence</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_wells">Poison Wells</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_war_declare">The declare war option is used to officially open armed hostilities with another faction, as opposed to simply marching into their territory to stake your claim. Never declare war without first considering the consequences, as an ill-prepared assault could have consequences resulting in your reduction to satrapy or client status, or worse: the annihilation of your faction. Note that when making your declaration the check box asking allies to join you is defaulted to yes. Your allies will assess the situation and may agree to declare war, but might just as easily break off your alliance, leaving you to fend for yourself.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_shield_screen">Shield Screen Formation</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_flanking_melee_double">This variant of the melee double formation arranges its ships two deep in order to smash through the enemy centre to split their formation. Heavier ships are furthest from the centre of the formation.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_crossings_attack">Attacking a River Crossing</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_fleet_access_on">When an army attempts to cross the sea, a transport ship is automatically supplied to provide passage. While these ships are similar to military vessels, they are slower, more cumbersome and are unable to withstand sustained damage. With that in mind, transport ships require the protection of your fleets if they are to transport large armies across the sea. Selecting a fleet and right-clicking on a transport provides an armed escort for the journey: any attacks on the transport will have to face the fleet first. To disembark an army or agent onto land, select its transport ship and right-click on the coast.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_parties">Depending on your faction’s culture, the first decision in your campaign may be the selection of a party to represent, which may take the form of a family or tribe. Alternatively, you will be assigned one. Throughout the campaign you must manage your party’s influence in relation to the others such as the Senate, court or tribal council. While it is possible to achieve a balance of power, you may choose to push your party forward to gain more or sit back and allow its standing to diminish. In a republic, both paths can lead to conflict, whilst in a tribe or monarchy any show of weakness may be challenged, again leading to civil war.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_naval_topography_shallows">Shallow Water</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_intro_formations">Each of these formations enables the effective implementation of a tactic, instantly forming up your army or fleet to maximise its strengths or exploit a weakness in the enemy. Formations can be assigned at any point during a battle, but are best set up during the deployment phase. Units in formation will maintain their fixed shape and spacing whilst carrying out orders.</string>

Rebellion becomes a risk when the people are so unhappy that repression can no longer contain public order."</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_quick_save_load">You can save your game at any point by pressing Ctrl + S on your keyboard. Saves will be labelled as “Quick Save”. To instantly load the last save simply press Ctrl + L on your keyboard.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_arson">Your spy inflicts considerable damage to a single building within a target settlement. Targeting gates will open them in preparation for a siege attack, whilst sabotaging a port will inflict minor attrition damage to any garrisoned fleet. The success of this agent action is dependent on the spy’s zeal and any skills, traits and household members or objects they may have.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_guerrilla">Your champion’s presence reduces public order in the target province. It can also increase recruitment costs and its constituent regions more vulnerable to authoritarian agent actions. The chances of this action’s success depend on your champion’s zeal, which is in turn affected by their skills, character traits, and the presence of any household members or objects they may have.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_cavalry_front_triple_line">This formation arranges units in three lines with cavalry at the front, missile infantry in the middle, and melee infantry at the back.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_tut_help_intro">If you are new to Total War, or want to quickly become familiar with the world of Total War: ROME II, there are two ways of learning the three game elements: campaigns, land battles and naval battles. These are:</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_screech">Screech</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_offices">Cursus honorum are the offices and commissions that can be allocated to generals in your faction when they reach a certain age or rank. They work rather like character traits or household members or objects in that they give useful effects. There is a power cost associated with cursus honorum, meaning they can be used to placate useful but potentially dangerous individuals. When all the criteria for a level of cursus honorum have been met, the secure promotion button will be enabled; click on it to bestow the office.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_siege_weapons">Siege artillery units such as onagers can be recruited in the same manner as other units. However, siege engines are constructed on-site and deployed when assaulting enemy settlements, taking a number of turns to complete before they can be used in an attack. Ranging from simple battering rams to hulking siege towers, they directly connect with enemy walls, but are heavy, slow moving and vulnerable to attack. As such, it’s advisable to escort them lest the enemy sally out to meet their besiegers.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_phase">The Deployment Phase</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_wells">Your spy uses cunning to poison the wells in the target province, causing damage to all units within its local garrison. This also reduces the settlement’s ability to hold out when under siege. The success of this agent action is dependent on the spy’s cunning and any skills, traits and household members or objects they may have.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_mounted_fire_parthian">Any unit with this attribute can fire all around itself, rather than just in front.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_wreck">Your spy uses zeal to damage baggage and equipment belonging to the target army, temporarily diminishing the quality level of one item for all units within it. Certain skills, character traits or household members or objects can increase the effectiveness of this action.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_defences_spike_traps">Spike traps are sunken stakes or groups of stakes concealed by foliage. Often producing more kills when charging, the foliage collapses when stepped on causing injury or death by impalement.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_army_attack_resistance">Resistance to Occupation</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_inspire">This ability enables your general to target a friendly unit to improve their combat skills for a short time.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_provinces_plague">Plague</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_slaughter">There is no place for subtlety when your champion charges at the target to brutally kill them. His level of zeal, along with the cunning of the target character, will influence the success of this action. Zeal can be increased via the acquisition of skills, character traits, and any household members or objects your agent may have with them.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_power">Your party can gain influence by completing missions, winning victories on the battlefield, and through political machinations back home. Generals with some experience can be left to lead your armies and fleets or be granted political office, known as cursus honorum. While offices cause a gradual increase, a successful general provides a major boost to your party’s influence during wartime. Although it can be left to accumulate, influence can also be used to carry out agent actions, such as assassination, aimed at undermining the influence of another party within your faction.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_spear">Spear</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_frenzied_charge">This ability increases the speed of a charge, its damage and the attack capabilities of the unit whilst reducing defensive capabilities for an extended period.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_shield_screen">The shield screen is a static defensive formation ideally used when defending a position or to block city streets, helping reduce its weakness to flanking manoeuvres. Units with this ability raise their shields in a static defensive formation, increasing their defensive capabilities.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_enc_help_open">Using the Encyclopaedia</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_wedge">Use this formation to stab through the enemy line with your forward melee ships, giving you room to manoeuvre and rake their decks with missile fire prior to boarding.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_solicit">The spy uses their authority to seek out a third party to eliminate the target. The spy’s level of authority, along with the zeal of the target character, will influence the success of this action. Authority can be increased by the presence of skills, character traits, and household members or objects.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_resources">Resources are the natural elements and manufactured goods present in a region. They can be exploited to your faction’s benefit, so other factions will target your territory if they wish to obtain resources they do not currently have access to. Since each region contains different resources, some more valuable than others, so it is wise to keep an army nearby to protect them.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_fleet_access_on">Transports, Embarking & Disembarking</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_siege_defence">Whilst your armies protect threatened regions, your settlements have their own local garrisons to act as rudimentary defence forces. These men are stationed within a settlement and cannot leave their posts to join your armies on campaign. The types of garrison troops available depend on the buildings constructed in a particular settlement. Whilst not the most skilled soldiers, garrisons who defend against besieging forces will develop strength and experience over time. Ports have an equivalent garrison navy to protect against raids and naval blockades.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_steady_retreat">This ability reduces the mass and defensive capabilities of the activating unit, as well as making its morale unbreakable for an extended period.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_phase">The deployment phase is the period of time between arriving on a battlefield or seascape and the start of the battle itself, where you can arrange your units into the formation of your choice. All units can be secretly arranged apart from siege engines, due to their size. When complete, press the start battle button to begin fighting.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_index_resources">Resources</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_warcry2">Affecting up to four nearby enemy units, this ability heavily reduces their morale, melee defence capabilities and movement speed. Once activated, there will be a cooling-off period before it can be used again.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_fleet_blockades">"A blockade is a cordon of ships that prevents any trade going through a [[url=""encyclopedia/how_to_play/018e_enc_manual_actions_campaign_construction.html#enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_infrastructure_ports""]]port[[/url]] whilst it is in place and any fleet moored there from escaping without fighting a battle. It can be broken by a naval attack on the blockading fleet. You can blockade a port by right-clicking on it as you would another fleet, with your own fleet selected. If there is an enemy fleet moored there, a cordon graphic will appear to indicate a blockade is under way. Otherwise, your fleet will row straight into the port and occupy it."</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_slaughter">Slaughter</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies">Spies are subterfuge experts, recruited via the recruit agents button when a settlement is selected. They can be recruited anywhere in your empire and are invisible to the enemy until detected. Spies are vulnerable to champions and exceptionally effective against dignitaries.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_spear">This spear-shaped formation allows you to drive a hole through the enemy's line with your heaviest ships at its point, melee ships in the centre and missile support at the rear.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_groups_controlled">AI Control of Grouped Units</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_siege">"In order to gain control of a garrisoned and fortified settlement it is often necessary to lay siege. During a siege your troops surround it and can either attempt to starve the defenders into capitulation or launch a direct assault using a variety of artillery and siege engines. Also, the besieged force may choose to sally out to meet you on the battlefield, but be aware that defeating them will not automatically result in the surrender of the settlement to you. Victory in a siege turns ownership of the province over to your faction. You then have the option to occupy peacefully or loot it. Looting provides a cash lump sum but carries a greater penalty to [[url=""encyclopedia/how_to_play/020_enc_manual_public_order.html""]]public order[[/url]] than occupation alone. There will also be public order issues if the new owners of a region are of a different culture to that of the populace."</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_steady_advance">This ability increases the mass and attack capabilities of the activating unit, as well as making its morale unbreakable for an extended period.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_defences_spike_traps">Spike Traps</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_resistance">Following the conquest of a region there will continue to be a degree of unrest in response to the change of ruler, especially one belonging to a different culture. This is called “resistance to occupation”. It declines gradually over time, but never totally disappears, so it is wisdom to leave adequate garrisons behind and manage taxation carefully.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_cavalry_counter_tactics">This ability improves a unit's combat skill capabilities when fighting against cavalry, whilst reducing its defensive capabilities for a time.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_crossings_defence">When defending a river crossing it may be best to stand back in order to stay out of range of enemy missile troops. When their main force starts to cross, rush a couple of units up to stop them. Also be wary of multiple crossings.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_fleet_fragments_repairs">A ship that has been damaged in combat must be repaired. In this instance, move to a friendly port to begin the process. The crew will be replenished at the same time.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_blade">Your spy gets close to the target character before killing them with a hidden knife. Their zeal, along with the cunning of the target character, influences the success of this action. Zeal can be increased via the acquisition of skills, character traits, and the presence of household members or objects.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_provinces_growth">As your campaign progresses, growth enables surplus population to accumulate via the primary buildings in your settlements, enabling them to expand. Certain buildings will improve that rate of growth. However, the larger your settlements, the more food is consumed, so it is important to keep food producing buildings upgraded in tandem with the size of your settlement in order to avoid shortages.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_buildings">Buildings facilitate unit production, can increase income, and improve governmental control within a province. The number of slots available for building inside a settlement depends on its level - so the larger the city, the greater the number of buildings it can contain. Any chain of buildings can be constructed in these slots, although some buildings require the presence of certain resources or the research of certain technologies before they can be constructed.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities">In addition to attributes, there are a number of helpful abilities that can only be utilised by a unit or ship during a battle. Some are enabled by the presence of an attribute, others by researching military technologies in the campaign game. When a unit or ship is selected, the abilities available to it appear at the bottom of the screen. You can mouse over each button to see what it does. Simply click on the appropriate button to activate it. After use, many abilities cannot be used again for a “cooldown” period, so it is important to use them sparingly and only at crucial moments.</string>

As such, if you do not construct buildings from the sanitation chain, an army moves into a diseased region or settlement or close to an infected army, there is a chance they will contract plague within a few turns. Plague will cause attrition within an army or fleet and reduce growth in a population.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_intro">When you selected a faction, you also chose a family or party to represent within its political system. Your faction leader is the head of the party you chose. Many characters and subjects in your campaign contribute gravitas to your party's overall influence. The more ambitious a character is, the more useful they are likely to be to your faction. However, it is a double-edged sword: high ambition can lead to a bid for power through civil war, so it is important to keep an eye on such characters, they are not necessarily to be trusted. You can interact with any character involved in politics, regardless of their party, by adopting them, bribing them, marrying them to a daughter of your party, spreading reputation-damaging rumours about them, or having them assassinated. </string>

Stones can either sunk into the ground or layed in irregular piles. Infantry find these difficult objects to traverse, whereas cavalry can only pass through by picking routes between the stones. This slowing effect produces an effective killing zone in and around the stones, ideal ground for missile units to trap their targets.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_garrison">By moving an army into a settlement, it becomes part of the garrison. Whilst inside, its units can replenish any losses at a faster rate and, if the settlement is attacked, will have improved morale. A garrisoned army suffers attrition when under siege if occupying a landlocked settlement or a port which is both under siege and blockade.</string>

A faction can develop technology along three paths of specialisation, each consisting of three interlocking modules. While each technology has its own inherent benefits, researching all technologies within a module has an overall effect that is greater than the sum of its parts. To begin, simply select the item you wish to research.

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_undermine">Use of this action disrupts the target army, temporarily reducing its general’s authority, whilst reducing its ability to attack and defend in the field. Undermining authority has the added benefit of increasing vulnerability to further acts of subterfuge and reducing zone of control on the campaign map. The effectiveness of this action is dependent on your dignitary’s own authority, which can be increased by skills, character traits, and household members or objects.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_threats">A dignitary can disrupt his target army by temporarily reducing its zeal with threats that a more powerful army is poised to destroy it. This dents the morale of its general and his bodyguard, whilst also diminishing the impact of their charge and both their melee and missile attack capabilities. On the campaign map, the army as a whole becomes more vulnerable to subterfuge.

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_skirmish">Ideal for skirmish battles, this formation places missile infantry on the front line flanked by missile cavalry. Melee infantry form the second line with melee cavalry on the flanks.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_assassins">Dignitaries never get their hands dirty if they can avoid it, instead hiring professional killers to remove their targets from the campaign. This action’s chances of success depend on your dignitary’s level of authority, along with the zeal of the target character. Authority can be increased through the acquisition of skills, character traits, and household members or objects.</string>

Left-clicking on a settlement, army or agent selects it; all orders are issued by right-clicking on your chosen target.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_flanking_missile_single">This formation enables a strong missile battery in the centre, with melee ships poised to close in from the flanks. Heavier ships are furthest from the centre of the formation.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_fatigue">As a battle progresses, the units involved gradually become exhausted due to the high level of physical effort required to run and fight for such a protracted length of time. Once a unit becomes exhausted, even moving slowly becomes a great effort, leaving them particularly vulnerable to cavalry charges. In order to combat fatigue, do not run everywhere and ensure that your troops are adequately reinforced before they become exhausted.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_factions">Factions are split into two types: major and minor factions. A major faction is playable based on their geographical position and importance during the period covered by the grand campaign. A minor faction is unplayable, but will still make conquests. Each faction belongs to a culture that dictates its style of buildings and types of unit. Each faction has a set of characteristics particular to them, known as faction traits. Use this page to investigate your rivals! </string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_skill_branches">As a general gains experience by leading your armies into battle, his rank and skills develop across three distinct disciplines. The “Commander” develops his influence over his troops in battle, improving his ability to inspire and rally them. The “Strategist” develops across a campaign by reducing recruitment costs, speeding-up unit replenishment, and increasing army movement extents. The “Warrior” has influence on both the battle and campaign maps, using his growing reputation to improve unit abilities and reduce the enemy’s morale on the battlefield, whilst increasing happiness throughout friendly regions and provinces. Your general can progress evenly in each discipline or choose to specialise in a single area.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_regions">Regions contain both resources and settlements in which you can construct buildings to improve their strategic and economic potential, enabling growth. Depending on settlement size and available resources, different chains of buildings will become available for development. Since not all resources are available in all regions, some regions will become targets for your rivals, so it is wise to keep a military presence nearby should a vital region be attacked.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_raphia">This formation places a main line of pikemen with heavy infantry to the left and light infantry to the right. Cavalry are positioned on the flanks with missile infantry in front and elephants on the flanks as well. This formation was favoured by Ptolemy IV of Egypt when he defeated the Seleucids at Raphia in 217BC.</string>

Wet conditions will affect the usefulness of missile weapons only when playing in single player mode. This means that [[url=""encyclopedia/how_to_play/060i_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_arrow_land.html""]]fire arrows[[/url]] will not work (and therefore cannot be used by either side). [[url=""encyclopedia/how_to_play/053_enc_manual_battle_conflict_fatigue.html""]]Fatigued[[/url]] units also recover more slowly in wet weather or snow. It is also much more difficult to set a building or ship alight in the rain, and by the same token anything on fire will be extinguished more quickly due to the downpour.

Enemy units (not ships) will be concealed if they are 600 metres away or further."</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_forests">Be careful when fighting in woods or forests, cavalry will be far less effective due to the restrictions on movement provided by tree cover. Similarly, siege weapons can be fired when deployed in a wood or forest, but their effectiveness will be greatly reduced due to the proximity of the trees.</string>

However, dealing with them can be a double-edged sword, as enslaving enemy prisoners following battles or capture of their settlements can damage diplomatic relations with other factions of the same culture. Once captured, slaves are automatically distributed across your empire. If their numbers grow too large there may be dissent, which if left unchecked can eventually lead to a slave revolt.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_battle_stances">When auto-resolving a battle, you can give high level instructions to your generals on how to fight the upcoming battle by selecting a battle stance first. Comparing the composition of each army before choosing the stance best suited for the situation ensures a much better result. The balanced battle stance enables armies to retreat from the battle and, unlike other stances, doesn’t give bonuses or penalties to either the attacker or defender. The following stances are possible:</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_index_regions">Regions</string>

Your force rampages through the settlement, damaging buildings, and robbing the populace. Looting carries a public order penalty and diplomatic relations between your faction and the previous owners of the settlement are damaged. Anyone captured is automatically enslaved.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_coercion">The threat of violence can be very persuasive when attempting to coerce a target onto a course of action decided by you. Your dignitary’s zeal, along with the cunning of the target character or the strategic abilities of the target general, will determine the success of this action. Zeal can be increased through the acquisition of skills, character traits, and household members or objects.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_corruption">By deploying a dignitary in a foreign province, security can be reduced, which also increases faction-wide corruption.

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_temptation">An attempt to manipulate a foreign agent through underhand trickery can work very well against an unsuspecting target. Your champion’s cunning, along with the target’s zeal, determines its chances of success. Cunning can be increased via skills, character traits, and the presence of any household members or objects.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_campaign_zone_of_control">Zones of Control</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_cannae">A light infantry centre flanked by heavy infantry. Missile infantry form the front row and cavalry are placed at the rear. Hannibal used this formation in his crushing victory at Cannae in 216BC.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_war_join">Demand Join War</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_flanking_missile_double">Melee ships at the centre of this two-deep formation can push into either side of an enemy fleet whilst the central missile ships attack the pinned-down forces. Heavier ships are furthest from the centre of the formation.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_default">When in default stance an army or fleet operates as normal, without bonuses or penalties under any circumstances. There is no action point cost for adopting it.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_provinces_food">Food</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_kill_elephants">Kill Elephants</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_scare">Some units are able to frighten others simply by their presence. Some can frighten all enemy units, some just affect elephants, and some will scare horses.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_war_coordination">War co-ordination is not a diplomatic option as such, but you can initiate from the faction list of the diplomacy panel. It makes your allies increase their efforts to destroying a designated target. You don't have to talk to a specific faction to designate a war coordination target (either settlement, army or agent); when you specify the target, all your allies become just more likely to send their armies and agents against it.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_flying_wedge_formation">Flying Wedge Formation</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_scare_immune">A unit with this attribute cannot be scared by any of the scare attributes mentioned above.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_patrol">Fleets can be ordered to patrol the sea region they are stationed within. This stance enables them to passively detect and reduce piracy, also improving their ability to defend themselves if attacked during a turn.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_march">An army ordered to carry out a forced march gets a significant increase in the action points available to it, but is unable to initiate a battle. Furthermore, a marching army has a reduced line of sight, reflecting its focus on the job in hand; the drawback being that it is more susceptible to ambushes. If attacked, all units in a marching army suffer reduced morale to reflect the inherent surprise element.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_objectives">The objectives panel defaults to show your faction's chapter objectives, with bonus objectives available by clicking on the numbered buttons down the left-hand side. The rewards for successful completion of an objective together with the time allotted for doing so are displayed at the bottom of the panel. Press the button on the right-hand side to see your ultimate objectives for the entire campaign, select the type of victory you wish to play for - military, economic or cultural - using the buttons down the left-hand side.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_armenian">This formation places heavy melee infantry at its centre flanked by light melee infantry. Missile infantry are positioned in front, with heavy and light melee cavalry behind.</string>

A negative trait is acquired gradually from a certain pattern of behaviour and can usually be expunged by a continued display of the opposite behaviour."</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_persian">Missile units occupy the front line with light cavalry on their flanks, then a second line of melee infantry with heavy cavalry on their flanks.

Their level of authority, along with the zeal of the target character, influences the success of this action. Authority can be increased through skills, character traits, and household members or objects.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_mislead">This action disrupts the target army, temporarily reducing its general’s cunning by hindering his movements in battle and increasing the cooling down time before his own special abilities can be used again. Misleading command also reduces line of sight on the campaign map, making the army more vulnerable to further subterfuge. The success of this action depends on your dignitary’s zeal, which can be improved by skills, character traits, and the presence of household members or objects.</string>

This means you can look for new allies to help if the war is not necessarily going your way. When they join you in a war, missions can be offered to all your allies, vassals, satrapies, etc. - although there is a chance they may not be accepted.

The presence of the general alone can improve morale and highly-trained, elite units have much higher morale from the outset. Heroes also improve morale of those around them by their presence.

Each one has its advantages and drawbacks, costs a number of action points to execute and once entered, the force will stay in that stance until given a different order.

If you are invited to join a war you will be automatically granted access to your ally's territory for the duration of that war.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_naval_boarding">During a boarding action the crew of one ship will attempt to take over another with a combination of melee and support from missile troops. With your own ship selected, click on the boarding button and then pick a target vessel to order your ship to close with it and send an armed group aboard to capture it. Boarding actions call for a high degree of skill and courage in the troops taking part, and can be cancelled at any time by issuing a contradictory order.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_defences_barricades">Barricades are designed to waylay an opponent rather than inflict casulties. Often made from trees, stones or dug earth, a barricade can stop a cavalry charge, slow an infantry march, or create a killing zone for missile units.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_training">The presence of a champion within a friendly army can boost their zeal and increase the experience for all units within it whilst the agent remains in their ranks. Zeal influences the morale of an army’s general and his bodyguard. It also improves their charge, melee attack, and missile attack skills. On the campaign map, fervour increases resistance against authoritarian agent actions, improves an army’s action points, and increases the profits from raiding. The effectiveness of this action is dependent on your champion’s zeal and certain skills, traits and household members or objects they may have acquired.</string>

In addition to zeal, the target character’s own cunning or the strategic abilities of the target general also affect this action’s chances of success. Zeal can be increased via the acquisition of skills, character traits, and any household members or objects your agent may have with them.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_fatigue">"A unit that is resistant to [[url=""encyclopedia/how_to_play/053_enc_manual_battle_conflict_fatigue.html""]]fatigue[[/url]] will take longer to tire in battle."</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_admin">A dignitary can improve security and reduce administration costs when sent to a friendly province. Strong civil administration influences a population’s satisfaction with its ruling faction, can reduce construction costs and increase vigilance towards subterfuge. The success of civil administration is dependent on your dignitary’s authority, which varies depending on the skills and character traits they have acquired, in addition to the presence of any household members or objects.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_generals">The general has a huge influence on his army’s fortunes in battle, not least because the abilities at his disposal can turn the tide in their favour. Each faction can unlock generals’ abilities and develop them in-line with skills and experience, sometimes upgrading them to become stronger or affect more units. There are two main types: powerful lingering abilities like “The Fear”, which can be used only a handful of times due to its longer cooldown time, and short impact boosts like “War Cry” that pass quickly but can be used many times. As a general or admiral improves each of his three attributes, he will progressively unlock further abilities.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_diamond_formation">Diamond Formation</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_generals">Generals and admirals are used to command armies and fleets in battle. Their attributes influence the effectiveness with which their army or fleet fights. Generals can acquire skills, character traits, and household members or objects as they gain experience in battle and increase in rank, as well as cursus honorum offices to convey additional bonuses. Recruit a general by selecting a settlement and then clicking on the raise forces button. Available candidates are displayed there. Select one and then click on the raise army button to hire him and begin mustering a force.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_legacies">When an army is first mustered it is named, given a unique emblem and, from that point on, creates its own legacy through its actions in the field. This enables the development of skills – traditions – that have positive effects in the same way that skills benefit the characters that have them. Some traditions are unique to certain factions, affecting aspects of both battles and campaigns. An army’s legacy and traditions forever remain with its emblem, living on long after its original troops have succumbed to their fates. When a new army is raised, you can choose to hand down the legacy of its forebears to your newest recruits.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_cant_run">Cannot Run</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_harass">Your champion harasses the target army, reducing the melee attack and defence abilities of all units within it, along with the firing rate of any missile units it may contain. The effectiveness of this action is dependent on your champion’s cunning, which in turn varies due to skills, character traits, and any household members or objects that may accompany them.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_stampede">This ability improves a unit's charge for an extended period of time.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_repair">Buildings damaged during sieges or through sabotage can be repaired.

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_tech">Technology reflects the advancement of your faction through new ideas and techniques, allowing you to construct advanced buildings, new unit types or greatly improved equipment. A faction can develop technology along three paths of specialisation, each consisting of three interlocking modules. While each technology has its own inherent benefits, researching all technologies within a module has an overall effect that is greater than the sum of its parts.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_campaign_battle_post">Post-battle Statistics</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_coercion">The threat of violence can be very persuasive when attempting to coerce a target onto a course of action decided by you. Your champion’s zeal, along with the cunning of the target character or the strategic abilities of the target general, will determine the success of this action. Zeal can be increased through the acquisition of skills, character traits, and household members or objects.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_boshin_tech_goals">Setting a research goal is a useful feature whereby you specify a technology you wish to acquire and the game will then highlight any pre-requisites, selecting the shortest route and researching them one at a time until your goal has been reached. If a goal has not been selected the game will warn you at the end of each turn until you do so.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack">"An army can attack another army, a port or a settlement. An attack on a settlement will result in a siege taking place. If the target is further away than your army's movement extent will allow, it will take more than one turn to reach it and launch an attack. Once an army has reached its target the battle panel will be displayed, prompting you to fight on the battlefield, [[url=""encyclopedia/manual/0067_enc_page_campaign_play_interface_battle_pre.html# enc_text_manual_ui_battle_auto""]]resolve the battle automatically[[/url]], withdraw or lay siege (when appropriate)."</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_diamond_formation">Diamond formation helps cavalry charges break through enemy lines. It was used successfully by Alexander the Great’s army. A unit with this ability moves into a diamond-shaped attack formation designed to break battles lines with its improved charge.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_recruitment">Units are the constituent parts of your army and are divided into classes that broadly define their role on the battlefield. They are recruited directly to your general, either in the field or when garrisoning a settlement. This is known as mustering. The only troops displayed are those troop types available in the region in which he is currently standing, i.e. it is not possible to draw in recruits from other regions. Select your general and then the recruit units button. Left click on a unit card to add it to the recruitment queue. When ready, units will automatically appear in the army of the mustering general.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_slaves">Whilst inside a settlement, your champion’s presence increases unrest amongst the slaves living there. This creates a continual decline in public order that will eventually lead to a slave revolt. The success of this action is dependent on your champion’s authority, which varies depending on the skills and character traits they have acquired, in addition to the presence of any household members or objects.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_finances">Taxation is managed via the trade & finance panel. It shows a summary of your projected income, maps the effect that the current tax rate is having on public order and wealth, and allows the adjustment of tax levels globally for every region under your control. In most cases, adjusting tax levels should fix the problem, although it is also possible to exempt a region from taxation there, which also prevents short-term food shortages.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battlefield_victory">The scale of any victory in battle is measured by the number of casualties suffered by each side. However, in siege, port siege and encampment battles the attacker can capture key positions known as victory points. When two thirds of the available victory points have been captured, or the only one in the case of minor settlements or encampment battles, the defenders’ victory tickets will start to diminish. The defender must reclaim their victory points to stop this happening or lose the battle when the number of tickets reaches zero.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_command_stars">On the campaign map a general’s rank - represented by the stars to the left of his character details panel - indicate his experience in the field and define his command ability when auto-resolving battles. If the general also holds a cursus honorum office the effects of his position increase in line with his rank.

When using it, the following bonuses and penalties are applied: cavalry and other mounted units receive an attack bonus, whilst enemy spear infantry receive a bonus when fighting against them; missile units on both sides have their effectiveness reduced; your units get a global attack bonus, whilst the enemy gets a defence bonus; retreat is not an option for either side, so expect casualties to be high.

Additionally, in sieges, if attacking, the more siege engines you have (towers, ladders, etc.), the more effective your spear and melee infantry become; if defending, the walls offer less protection, but the more spear and melee infantry units you have, the smaller the enemy’s bonuses for their siege artillery (onagers, ballistas, etc.)"</string>

The details of such an agreement are not visible to you, you simply set it up and the rest of the negotiation is implied by the other party's acceptance. Trade agreements are hugely profitable for the factions involved. Once an agreement is in place, a trade route is established between the two, with any ports or settlements along it receiving a share of the income. The trade of natural resources influences their global prices by the law of supply and demand. Trade agreements continue until one party breaks the agreement, suffering a penalty to their diplomatic relations. Long-standing trade partners develop a healthy respect for each other, reflected by increased income from trade routes over the life of the agreement.</string>

For example, some units are inherently fearsome, so their very presence in battle can “Frighten” an enemy, reducing their morale. Similarly, some units “Can Hide”, enabling them to remain out of sight of enemy units within certain distances."</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_confederation">A confederation allows factions to join together for the common good, combining military resources to make all members stronger. Upon formation, your target faction ceases to act independently and their strongest armies and fleets become confederation property. Anyone already at war with the target faction may choose to declare war on every faction within it.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_experience_sea">Experience for ship crews works in the same way as it does for units, except that when a ship is unable to continue fighting - either due to surrender, routing or its destruction - all remaining experience points that its crew might have earned are instead split between the ships it was in combat against.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_boarding">Any naval ramming action can result in boarding. The boarding button orders your ship to close with the target vessel and sends an armed group aboard to capture it. This action can be cancelled at any time by issuing another, conflicting, order.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_visibility">In Total War: ROME II, visibility of enemy units depends entirely on what your own units can see at any given time, so, if the enemy are hidden by a building or the terrain itself, they may not be visible to your forces. By the same token, enemy units may disappear during a battle if they pass out of view of your troops. An eye icon appears above your unit when it is hidden or when it is out of the enemy’s line of sight. It will disappear when your unit has been spotted by the enemy. It’s also important to note that visibility is entirely separate to the hiding attribute.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_capture">There are a number of potential outcomes following a successful siege action. The victorious besieger is always given the option to occupy or raze the captured settlement, the other options are dependent on certain conditions being met:</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_double_time">Double time means the crew of a fleet of ships row twice as fast as they otherwise would. This stance enables them to travel much further within a turn, but means they cannot carry out an attack once they reach their destination until the following turn. There is also a morale penalty as the crew become exhausted, lasting as long as the stance is active.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_culture">Each faction belongs to a culture that dictates its style of buildings and types of unit. There are five culture types: Roman, Hellenic, Punic, Barbarian, and Eastern. Dignitaries can be sent ahead of an army to spread your culture amongst a population before you conquer them, heading off any public order problems that may arise if you conquer a region belonging to a different culture. </string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_tut_help_campaign">Whether you are a new player or have some experience of previous titles, the prologue will guide you through the basic set of features needed to play a full campaign. </string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction">When you select a settlement, the construction tab will appear. Left-click on a building to add it to the construction queue, and again to remove it. The cost of construction is displayed at the bottom and the time required is shown in the top left of the picture. Buildings facilitate unit production, can increase income, and improve governmental control within a province. The building chains constructible at each settlement often depend on the availability of particular resources, or the research of certain technologies, before they can be constructed. Right-click on a building's picture to view its description and statistics.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_capture_occupy">Your force occupies the settlement, receiving a penalty to public order. Anyone captured is automatically released.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_fragments_merge">Forces that are not large enough to be effective could be destroyed if attacked by a superior force, so it is prudent to merge any fragments together. It is possible to merge two friendly armies or fleets together when neither is at full strength (a full strength force is twenty units in size). Merge by left-clicking on your first one and then right-clicking on the second. The first force will then move over to the second and the two will merge together. However, it is not possible to have more than one general within an army, so you must disband the lesser of the two after transferring his units. If there are twenty units or more in either force the merge panel will appear, so you can choose which units or ships to merge into a single force and which to leave behind.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_battle_destroyed_factions">In Total War: ROME II, when you capture a faction’s last settlement they are not automatically destroyed. Any remaining forces will immediately begin suffering attrition and will dedicate their time to trying to recapture a region in order to re-establish themselves as a viable faction.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_cavalry_testudo_formation">Cavalry Testudo Formation</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_heavy_missile_single">This formation allows you to shatter the enemy's centre with missile fire whilst your heavy melee ships close in on their flanks. The heaviest ships are positioned closest to the centre.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_military_admin">A dignitary embedded in a friendly army can improve its general’s authority attribute and reduce upkeep costs. Authority represents the influence of the general over his army and their attack and defence capabilities, making it more resistant to subterfuge on the campaign map and potentially increasing its zone of control. The effectiveness of this action depends on your dignitary’s own authority, which can be increased with skills, character traits, and household members or objects.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_hide">Ambush stance immobilises an army but increases its line of sight and makes it invisible to nearby enemy forces. If undetected, a hidden army can attack any enemy that wanders into its zone of control. The success of such an ambush depends on the quality of the commanders involved and the nature of the surrounding terrain.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_army_moves_blocked">Blocking Army Movement</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_slums">Slums</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_modes_wedge">Wedge formation is available to cavalry units whose general has the “Cavalry Commander” skill, its “arrow head” shape increasing the violence of their charge and enabling them to more easily break through a defending unit’s ranks. It can be toggled on and off by clicking on the wedge formation button that appears at the bottom of the screen when a cavalry unit is selected.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_triplex_acies">The classic triplex acies formation places melee infantry in three lines, with the lightest at the front and spearmen in the last line. Missile infantry are deployed at the front to skirmish, with cavalry at the rear and on the flanks.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_simplex_acies">A basic army formation with loose formation spearmen in the front row, equally spaced melee infantry behind, with cavalry at the back and missile infantry deployed at the very front.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_fervour">Military Fervour</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_civil_war">If your party becomes too powerful in a republic, mistrust and paranoia ultimately lead to a challenge for control of your faction. At this point, civil war ensues; the remaining parties unite and lead rebel forces to capture the capital and overthrow your regime. Similarly, should you be deemed too weak, you may be exiled as an enemy of the state, with little choice but to lead your armies against the usurpers in the capital. In a tribal society or a monarchy, your tribe or family branch could be challenged should they be deemed weak, again leading to civil war. Such conflicts can only continue for a limited time, at which point they are automatically resolved by treaty, the terms of which are decided by the balance of power at the point of resolution.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_fleet_moves_blocked">Positioning a fleet between two straits enables it to block other fleets from using that route and enemy armies or agents from crossing between the headlands.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_advisor_help_advisor_back">If you wish to hear or read a piece of advice again after it has played or been dismissed you can do so by clicking on the back button. Each click cycles back one piece of advice in reverse order - the latest piece first.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_naval_topography_land">There are many small islands and outcrops of rock protruding from the seas. They cannot be crossed, it is necessary to carefully row around them. They can be fired over, depending on the size of the ship in question and whether there are archers on board.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_modes_routing">Routing</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_the_fear_intimidate">This ability prevents a single targeted enemy unit from activating its abilities for an extended period.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_assault">Assault Patrol</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_moves">Left-click to select an army or fleet and then right-click to move it to any part of the highlighted area - this is the extent of its movement capability during a single turn.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_square_formation">This is a close, square formation which increases a unit's defensive capabilities. It is ideally used when you are outnumbered or want to pin down part of an enemy line.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_port_battles">If a port is attacked whilst ships are docked there, a siege battle must be fought for control of it. To achieve victory when attacking you must completely destroy the defending fleet or pound the port until it is reduced to rubble.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_management_family">The family & politics tab depicts the various parties within your ruling faction, enables you to assign cursus honorum offices, and engage in politics with them.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_battle_stances_protective">"Adopting protective stance ensures your units take a defensive position, advancing slowly in formation. They will attempt to retreat if things get out of control and won’t try to chase down retreating units to avoid getting enemy tricks and ruses. When using it, the following bonuses and penalties are applied: your spear infantry receives a bonus when fighting against cavalry, whilst mounted enemies get an attack bonus; missile units on both sides have their effectiveness increased; your units get a global defence bonus, whilst the enemy gets an attack bonus; forces will attempt to retreat if they suffer considerable losses.

Additionally, in sieges, if attacking, the more siege artillery you have (onagers, ballistas, etc.), the more effective your spear and melee infantry will become; if defending, the more spear and melee infantry you have, the smaller the enemy’s bonus for their siege engines (towers, ladders, etc.)"</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_second_wind">Second Wind (general)</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_advisor_help_advisor">Used to explain important game features to the player, the advisor will periodically appear in the top left-hand corner of the screen to give warnings and suggestions, their portrait flashing when a new message is triggered. Although the default is to show the text as the audio is playing, there is an option to isolate one or the other. There is also an option to hide the advisor graphics for the piece of advice currently being displayed. Left-clicking on the advisor portrait will repeat the audio for the advice that is currently on screen.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_cantabrian_circle">A unit with this ability can fire outwardly whilst riding in a circle, which enables them to concentrate their fire on a target whilst making them more difficult to hit with missiles.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_raid">When ordered into a raiding stance, your army or fleet draws income from nearby trade routes and settlements. This decreases its upkeep costs, but reduces its defensive capabilities and movement range on the campaign map. The amount of booty gained through raiding is relative to the size of your force and is deducted from the income of the route or settlement in question. Raiding in foreign territory harms diplomatic relations, but isn’t an overt act of war. In dire situations, a force may raid within its own territory, causing a degree of unrest as a result.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_vassals">Satrapies & Client States</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions">Champions are heroic warriors and experts in military matters. They are recruited via the recruit agents button when a settlement is selected and military technologies have been researched. Champions are vulnerable to dignitaries and especially effective against spies.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_slums">An empty construction slot or ruined building (one that is 100% damaged) can be turned into a slum. Slums consume food and generate squalor, but also increase population growth, enable the recruitment of mob units, and reduce the cost of recruiting light units.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_provinces_squalor">As your population increases, the conditions inside your settlements worsen as more and more people are crammed into the limited space. It is therefore sensible to upgrade buildings in the capital chain so living space expands to cope with a larger populace. Ignoring squalor eventually leads to public order problems. Some buildings increase squalor also, so always make sure there is enough space, food and income to soften the blow before selecting them for construction.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_camp">By setting camp, your army fortifies itself against attack and defends the surrounding area. Although immobile, a fortified army has greater defensive capabilities, line of sight and reinforcement range. If attacked, it can also deploy fixed defences such as barricades, wooden stakes, spike traps, and, if playing Rome, a temporary fort on the battlefield.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_army_moves">Movement of Forces</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_cavalry_testudo_formation">Cavalry testudo is a defensive formation ideally used when the enemy is fielding missile units and your cavalry need to be kept close to the frontline without being picked off. Units performing cavalry testudo raise their shields and angle themselves towards their aggressor, which improves their resistance to missile attack whilst still enabling them to break into a charge if desired.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_square_formation">Square Formation</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_units">Units are the constituent parts of your army and are divided into classes that broadly define their role on the battlefield. They are recruited from buildings: the higher the level of building, the more advanced the unit type availble. In order to recruit you must have a general, either in the field or inside a settlement. </string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_skills">When a general fights battles or an agent carries out their mission they gain experience. With enough experience behind them they will increase in rank and skill points will be issued. At this stage they may invest a skill point towards acquiring a new skill or upgrading an existing one, allowing you to shape a character's career path. Skills require one point per upgrade and one point before they are awarded. Certain skills are associated with specific ranks, meaning that they cannot be acquired until the character has reached that skill’s rank requirement. </string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_diekplous">This formation is a formation of multiple columns, designed to break into an enemy line and pin their fleet down for one-on-one engagements. It is best used against a fleet formed of a single line.</string>
<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_modes_loose">Although available to all units, loose formation is best used to increase the target area of missile units, make them more difficult for enemy missile troops to target (as they not standing closely packed together), and by cavalry to more easily ride down routers. Loose formation is not suitable for charges of any kind, as a closely-packed mass of men is crucial to the impact required to smash through a line. It can be toggled on and off by clicking on the loose formation button that appears at the bottom of the screen when a unit is selected.</string>

<string name="encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_provinces">A province consists of up to four regions, each one containing a settlement, the hub of activity within it and in which you can construct buildings to improve its strategic and economic potential, enabling growth. One of these is always the provincial capital, a major, walled settlement, whilst the remainder are minor settlements without defensive walls. Building construction improves the strategic and economic potential of settlements, enabling them to grow. Depending on settlement size and available resources, different chains of buildings are available for development. Over time, provincial growth enables you to develop settlements either by upgrading existing buildings or by constructing additional ones. Depending on settlement size and regional resources, different chains of buildings will become available for development. Coastal settlements can also contain port buildings that enable the construction of fleets.</string>

The best ways to stop a riot, and prevent it from escalating into a rebellion, are to either reduce taxes to appease the rioters or increase the garrison, which in turn increases repression and crushes the riot. Factors which may cause a riot are: [[url=""encyclopedia/how_to_play/018e_enc_manual_actions_campaign_construction.html#enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_castle""]]food shortages[[/url]], [[url=""encyclopedia/how_to_play/013_enc_manual_hud_finances.html""]]taxation[[/url]], the presence of rampaging enemy armies, and cultural unrest."</string>

It is possible for your own agents to enter your forces and settlements up to a maximum of three agents per force or settlement. When agents are embedded inside settlements, the effects provided by their presence gradually diminish - so a second agent provides a further 50% of the effects of the first, and a third provides a further 25%. Before carrying out an ordered action a prompt will appear, requiring confirmation. Every agent action has a monetary cost associated with it, which is stated on its panel.

The enemy army will not have the opportunity to move their units in any way until the battle starts, so deploy carefully to cause maximum confusion and disorder. If you decide not to launch an ambush, the army will pass without being alerted to your presence.

The factors that affect it are displayed on the region details panel, and include elements such as settlement level, presence of a garrison and the size of the tax burden placed on the populace. If unhappiness begins to outweigh happiness it will accumulate, eventually leading to rebellion if left unchecked. Keep taxes at reasonable levels, maintain sufficient food supplies and ensure that settlements are garrisoned to stop low public order bubbling over into rioting or worse, full-scale rebellion.</string>
