<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_01">Ba'al Hammon has granted wisdom to us all today. I shall offer sacrifice.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_reject_01">This morning, when I awoke, the cock did not crow. It was, I thought, an ill omen, and I was right…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_02">The hand of Ba'al Hammon is truly upon you if you show such wisdom in acceptance.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_reject_02">Think on this: blood will pay for all that goes amiss from this day forward. That will settle all accounts.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_03">Your wit and wisdom burn brighter than the Sacred Flame! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_reject_03">Very well. Ba'al Hammon has not granted you wisdom in this, but the gods move as they will. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_04">The people of Carthage thank you for your acceptance.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_reject_04">If this is your will, so be it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_05">You have served your people well, my thanks. And theirs, I imagine.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_reject_05">There is little wisdom in your decision, but so be it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_06">We have achieved much through our talks this day!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_07">Your wisdom is a credit to your people, it has been an honour!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_reject_07">Very well, our talks are at an end.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_03">We march our armies on other roads from this day on.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_08">We have agreement! Come, share a cup of wine with me!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_reject_08">Carthage has an ageless heart that remembers every slight…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_hand_over_region_03">You have shown your worth as rulers. These lands would do well under your control, if you will have them. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_02">My honourable master will leash in his mighty armies.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_09">Excellent! Now, let us eat together as friends!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_reject_09">Someone will make your people bleed for every foolish word you have spoken this day.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_hand_over_region_02">Our gods have spoken. These lands are not to be ours, but we wish to give them to friends…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_01">Ah, this is unfortunate, but we will agree. Our armies will no longer enter your domains.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_hand_over_region_01">We offer you these lands, for the omens and portents for our mastery have been unfavourable.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_attack_faction_01">We, the people of Carthage, request an attack on these animals.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_attack_faction_03">We humbly request that you teach these fools a hard lesson.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_attack_faction_02">If you were to attack these people you would find Carthage in your debt.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_10">Our agreement will bring much joy to our peoples!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_reject_10">Clearly your gods have not gifted you with wisdom.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_client_status_01">Carthaginians achieve the unachievable. But not even we would think this right!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_client_status_03">We Carthaginians are a proud people. We do not bend the knee!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_client_status_02">I should take your tongue for your impudence!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_military_access_01">Away with you and your creatures of darkness! Away, I say!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_military_access_02">The people of Carthage want no more of you or yours!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_military_access_03">Remove your armies from the lands of Carthage, now!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_attack_faction_01">Such an attack might be prudent, but I do not believe the Senate will make troops available.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_attack_faction_03">Our legions have their orders. Sadly for you their orders do not include acting on your orders.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_attack_faction_02">The Senate sees little need to expend swords and coin from Rome's purse on ill-judged adventures.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_01">The only gold I will give you is the piss from my slaves, and I begrudge you even that!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_02">The feeble and weak-willed may throw you meat, but we do not hold with feeding stray dogs. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_03">You think me a fool then? Or my people? Or our ancestors? One coin, and your begging would never end!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_nonaggression_pact_warning">End Non-Aggression Pact||Do you want to end your non-aggression pact with this faction?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_current_treaty_peace">Peace Treaty</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_war_09">No more talk. Now is the moment for the swords to have the next words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_war_08">The Gods have cast their dice, and war it will be. Mars will be honoured once more!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_war_01">Very well, Mars will buckle on his armour to defend Roman honour. Look to your funeral arrangements!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_war_03">You declare war on the Rome? Ha! Make sacrifice to your gods of the dead, for you will soon meet them!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_war_02">War is the Roman way! The Senators will sacrifice to Mars and Jupiter! Look to your imminent defeat!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_war_05">War is a well-trodden road for Romans. We will not flinch or turn aside. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_war_04">Very well! There is nothing closer to the true heart of a good Roman than the prospect of war and the spilling of enemy blood!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_war_07">So be it! Put your wives and children to the sword, and save them from slavery at Roman hands!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_war_06">The legions will meet this challenge. The men grow bored when they cannot look forward to a battle!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_07">Your words are olives, picked from a blighted tree. They look well enough, but taste foul.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_06">Such ripe words have their place, but I do not agree to the meat of your proposal. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_05">My people will not agree to such a proposal. It is philosophically offensive to them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_04">Your rhetoric and logic cannot be faulted but, somehow, your arguments lack a convincing flavour. I do not agree.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_03">Dull words rarely cut through sharp disagreements. We cannot accept your offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_02">By the gods! You show a rare wit in your proposals, but we cannot possibly agree to them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_01">Your words seem fair and just at first hearing, but I cannot agree after thought has done its work.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_third_party_join_war_03">You are strong and wise, and yet I wonder why you stand aside from this war. I beg you: fight!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_third_party_join_war_02">Your men will turn the enemies' bowels to water! Come, aid us in this war, I beg!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_third_party_join_war_01">Join your mighty strength with ours in this struggle. I ask for my people's sake.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_factor_broken_treaties">Broken treaties with</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_09">No. No. Such an arrangement offers comfort only to your people. We would find your words a hard couch indeed!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_08">No. Athena has lent you wits, and Hermes speed in your speech, but Zeus was stingy with the truth…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_cooperation_06">I humbly ask that you at least consider a formal treaty. Strong defences need good foundations.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_cooperation_05">Our joint enemies would tremble if we were your allies. Your strength, our wisdom, together, would achieve great things.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_cooperation_04">You are wise enough not to sit idly upon the bank, but to take the fish as it swims by…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_cooperation_03">Can you not see? Together, our armies could be nigh-invincible! The world will tremble before our collective might!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_cooperation_02">Glory, wealth, and a place in the histories. All of these will be ours when we are united as friends!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_cooperation_01">As all the gods look down on us they, too, must wonder why we are not firmer allies and friends…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_current_treaty_payments_receiving">Receiving money</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_too_many_counters_04">Our talk has gone from door to hearth and back again, and without result. It is time to stop.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_too_many_counters_06">Your talk has wandered along too many paths. I am lost, and ready to go home! No more talk today!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_too_many_counters_01">Stop! Stop! Even the gods grow weary listening to your bleating! Let me have ale now, not shrewish chit-chat!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_regular_payment_02">Come, come! Open your purse and allow the Roman eagle to wet its beak a little!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_regular_payment_03">Some in the Senate have, I am told, lavish tastes. They will fondly remember those who fund such tastes.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_too_many_counters_03">Your mind is awash with word-ale! You have said much, and nothing at all. Enough, then…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_too_many_counters_02">Even your God of Gossiping Women must have grown weary listening to your endless drone! Stop!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_regular_payment_01">Surely you would wish to be honoured as a friend of Rome by contributing to her coffers?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_04">You are brave indeed, to reject the shelter offered by the hand of Pharaoh, the all-defending.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_05">Before the final journey to the Underworld there are many partings. This is but one more. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_relationship_very_friendly">Very Friendly</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_war_10">Very well. Words have been wasted. Time will not be wasted in killing you all.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_06">Set aside the friendship of Pharaoh, from whom all blessings flow, and go into the darkness. Such is your path.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_01">A strange choice, to reject the friendly hand of Pharaoh, all-wise-all-knowing, in this fashion…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_02">I trust this courageous decision will not be one that you regret, as the crocodile said to the impetuous swimmer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_03">Walk your own path into the desert. But do not expect Pharaoh, the all-wise, to give you water…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_single_payment_01">The mighty Pharaoh, strength be His, has noticed that his treasure house is in some need of replenishment…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_single_payment_03">In his wisdom and prudence, Pharaoh, numismatist of heaven, desires that his store of coin be increased…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_single_payment_02">Mighty Pharaoh, the steward of the Earth, desires Egypt's coffers be filled with a reasonable amount of gold…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_10">"Were I to lay awake all night, staring at the Moon, my answer would still be a resounding ""No."""</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_military_access_02">Unfortunately, your soldiers are largely unwashed and foreign. They would disturb noble Pharaoh's peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_military_access_03">Respectful visitors who come to gaze slack-jawed upon Egypt's wonders are welcome, but not when they come armed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_military_access_01">The Pharaoh, unto whom all roads lead, cannot agree to let your armies march where they will.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_offer_or_demand_break_soft_military_access">Break Military Access Pact with:</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_06">Your people are lower than camel dung, drying in the desert sun, yet you propose a treaty? Bah!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_05">You insolence is well attested and demonstrated. Be careful, or I will demonstrate some inventive cruelty! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_04">You mistake politeness for concern as to your wellbeing. If all your people died, I would merely thank the gods.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_03">Mithra's hairy bulls! Your sickening ideas of what is right and proper are beyond my understanding.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_02">By the flame! I will not cast away all reputation by clambering into bed with a leprous whore!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_01">Our generals would flay my hide and use it for a drumhead if I shackled them to your walking corpses!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_war_declaration_02">Pray to your gods of the dead. Your foolishness has awoken the might and anger of Rome.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_war_declaration_03">An end to talk. The Senate will be pleased to add your lands to Roman domains!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_war_declaration_01">Praise be to Mars! Let us have an end of talk, then, and meet as proper men in open battle!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_war_declaration_06">So be it. You invite a storm and Romans will gladly aid Neptune in bringing one to you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_war_declaration_07">You have brought this on yourselves. Your people will curse your name when rivers run red with their blood.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_war_declaration_04">All Rome looks forward to seeing your leaders strangled, very, very slowly, during the triumphal celebrations!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_war_declaration_05">How would you like your defeat commemorated? An arch in Rome, or a nice column, or by the wailing of your enslaved people?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_war_declaration_08">You have destroyed yourself today. You have orphaned children and despoiled your women. By Mars, these things will happen!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_war_declaration_09">So you choose the sword. I trust your people will rightly thank you for bringing them a Roman war.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_06">My ba would wander the winds in shame if I agreed to such nonsense.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_07">"My heart would outweigh the Feather of Truth many times over if I said anything other than ""No""."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_04">There is virtue in you, if not in your words. I cannot agree, but do this with regret.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_05">The scorpion's sting is more gentle than a refusal, but a refusal is all I can offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_02">O! Pharaoh! Strength and wisdom to you! Grant me the wit to refuse this proposal politely!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_03">I will not trouble Pharaoh's ears, may blessings fall on him, with this proposal. Consider your words rejected!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_01">The Pharaoh, blessings on His seed and numberless children, will undoubtedly wish me to smile slightly as I reject your proposal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_peace_06">Rome does not offer peace easily but, to such as you, there is no shame is asking whether or not the time of peace is upon us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_trade_01">Your fine goods would be welcomed in Rome! Trade would see us all prosper, do you not think?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_peace_04">Your warriors do you much credit. Now, can your diplomats and envoys be equally worthy in seeking peace?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_trade_03">There is much to value in the goods of your merchants. Will you not send them into Roman lands?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_peace_05">As enemies you have been without equal in courage and honour. Now, however, the Senate wishes only peace with you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_trade_02">We Romans admire your merchants and their wares. We would both gain if trade was open between us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_peace_02">Your people have demonstrated much courage, but is it not time to now put aside the sword?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_peace_03">Rome legions and your armies have long contended in the field but the Senate feels that the time for peace has come.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_08">"Even if Bastet herself offered me the Sun and Moon, I could not say ""Yes"" to this proposal."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_09">Such a proposal would not reflect well on the glory and goodness of Pharaoh, and so must be rejected.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_peace_01">The Senate respectully asks for peace. What good is war? </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_01">What makes you think you are worthy as allies of Pharaoh, the Light of His people, when you should crawl in His presence?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_02">On your knees, insolent jackal! Now, beg forgiveness for this presumption, this... this stupidity! This heresy!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_factor_friendly_towards_enemies_negative">Friendly actions towards enemies</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_03">Your impudence is most interesting. I wonder if it would seem so appropriate to you in a pit of scorpions?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_04">Bah! Why should Pharaoh, lord of the Two Niles, shackle himself to your corpse in the name of cowardly safety?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_05">Ah! Are Egyptians particularly stupid? Why would we want formal ties to your obviously inferior kind?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_06">Do my ears hear right? You expect Pharaoh, master of an age-old divine land, to have formal ties to upstarts?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_regular_payment_03">Gold is strange stuff. It has the power to harden or soften men's hearts. Perhaps you would like some?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_regular_payment_02">The gods look favourably on those who do good deeds. Therefore, we offer you these payments…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_regular_payment_01">Our treasure houses bulge, and we would share some of that wealth with you, our friends!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_03">Your money may win favour among whores but we will not be used for your filthy pleasure.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_01">Be grateful that you are not eating this mighty treasure, piece by piece, with boiled leeks. You insult honour!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_03">Your gold has a taint about it that cannot be washed off the fingers. We do not want it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_02">Your wealth will buy you many slaves to sate your lubricious and disgusting tastes. It will not buy us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_01">Our merchants love gold, our people love gold, my master loves gold. But none of them love your gold!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_military_access_01">I am sorry, my friend, but our gods would be much offended by the presence of your soldiers.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_military_access_03">Our gates must remain closed and barred, even to your glorious armies.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_military_access_02">My lord is brave, warlike and enjoys the manly company of soldiers, but not of your soldiers. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_war_declaration_10">The Senate will turn to Rome's legions and they will set their swords to your people. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_05">That distant noise is the sound of your slumbering foes awaking to a day full of promise. For them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_04">The Gods of Olympus will look to our safety. Let us hope you are not visited by the gigantes…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_06">Perhaps you will find profit in setting aside our friendship? Although, for the life of me, I wonder where…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_01">We will respect your decision, even though it denies rational thought and good sense.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_03">I fear this ending will tempt beggars, bandits and wolves to come to both our doors…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_02">This is a bold decision and one that I hope you will not regret in days to come.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_single_payment_01">One sacrifice is needed, on the altar of our goodwill. I speak of gold, of course…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_10">Your words have virtue in your ears, but in mine they are the harshest of desert storms.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_single_payment_02">Between friends, the gift of gold is often taken to be a sign of deep affection and respect…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_single_payment_03">We are a mighty people, well versed in the uses of wealth and power. And so we love gold…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_offer_or_demand_non_aggression_pact">Non-aggression Pact</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_current_treaty_has_soft_military_access_indefinite">Military access ||By having a military access pact you can trespass upon this faction's territory without diplomatic penalties.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_player_must_become_vassal_01">Must we continue this game? Now is the time to accept Carthage as your master!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_player_must_become_vassal_02">Men should know when they are conquered.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_player_must_become_vassal_03">The people of Carthage are not unreasonable. They simply request that you accept us as your masters.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_regular_payment_01">Merchants do not rule in Rome, and so the Republic does not pay taxes to others.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_regular_payment_02">Sadly, our coffers will remain firmly closed. Roman gold does not travel well.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_regular_payment_03">Empty our coffers? I do not see how this benefits Rome at any time, or in any way.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_hand_over_region_02">In his infinite wisdom and divine rationality, Pharaoh is pleased to grant you mastery of these lands…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_hand_over_region_03">Pharaoh, all honour be His, in a spirit of friendship, is pleased to give you control of these lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_hand_over_region_01">The Lord of the Two Egypts, most high Pharaoh, grants you stewardship of these lands, if you wish it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_defend_against_faction_03">Our defences are weak, and our old folk know fear. Can you send men to help against the foe?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_receive_demanding_10">I have a fine collection of liars' tongues, would you like to see it?</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_military_access_03">Come now, see sense. Mars insists that Rome's soldiers be allowed to march where they will in your lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_demanding_04">I have little to gain in wasting the day on you. What you say had better please my ears!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_demanding_07">My time is better spent feasting and hunting than listening. So be quick with your chattering.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_defend_against_faction_01">I do not think that the Senate would approve of Roman troops being used like that. They would think it unmanly.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_defend_against_faction_02">Such a plan cannot be countenanced by the Senate at the moment. You must act without Rome.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_demanding_09">I speak only to gain your acceptance of my lord's offerings. You would do well to heed my words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_demanding_08">I am not here to debate, dissemble or over-haggle. I come seeking acceptance of proposals made.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_cancel_trade_01">We Carthaginians know much of the nature of trade-- enough to know we want none of yours!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_cancel_trade_02">The people of Carthage have spoken: your merchants are no longer welcome.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_cancel_trade_03">Our tastes have changed. We no longer desire your wares.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_angry_get_military_off_my_land_03">On this matter, the gods, the omens and my bowels are as one: get your armies out of our lands!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_defend_against_faction_01">We, the people of Carthage, come to you in our hour of need.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_state_gift_03">You enjoy a fine reputation among my people already, but a gift would make your worth clear even to doubters!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_demand_cooperation_04">We could stand, like brothers, with shields overlapped in the wall, our blades in hand, and defy the world!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_get_military_off_my_land_03">Surely your men would be happier in their own homes?</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_too_many_counters_01">Come back when you have ordered your thoughts, fool!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_too_many_counters_02">I am ready to throw myself into the ocean! A watery grave would be preferable to your prattle!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_too_many_counters_03">Your words are not those born of a sane mind! Be gone, before you taint me with your madness!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_too_many_counters_04">Remove yourself, my mind runs to dark places when I am sorely vexed!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_third_party_break_treaty_02">Surely you can see that it is now time to break all treaties and agreements with these worthless brigands?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_too_many_counters_05">I will hear no more! You have already wasted too much of my time!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_third_party_break_treaty_03">These people are no better than sand-dwelling thieves and grave-robbers! Surely you will set aside all treaties with them?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_too_many_counters_06">I refuse to dignify this nonsense with a response!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_third_party_break_treaty_01">Pharaoh, lord of all betwixt dawn and dusk, wonders if you would break your treaties with these mundane folk.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_offer_demand_01">I offer this now, because the gods wish it. I may not make this offer again.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_offer_demand_02">Hermes speed your acceptance, for my people have been most generous in offering even this much!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_offer_demand_03">Give careful thought to this offer. My people expect acceptance and, if Athena helps you, they may have it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_offer_demand_04">This is what I offer for my people, as blessed by the gods. Think carefully and be prudent.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_offer_demand_05">Athena inspired us in our wisdom. I suggest that you too should listen to her counsel in this matter. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_offer_demand_06">By Zeus, do not take this offer lightly. I make it now in friendship, but that can change…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_offer_demand_07">The words of the Oracle influenced our choice of proposal. Therefore, give your consideration appropriate seriousness. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_offer_demand_08">Accept the terms. Consider the alternatives, and you will see that there is very little sense in anything else.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_offer_demand_09">We are not inclined to bully or overawe, but you should consider your position carefully before you answer.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_get_military_off_my_land_02">By order of Pharaoh, divine master of Egypt and lesser lands, remove your troops forthwith!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_get_military_off_my_land_03">I will hear no argument against Pharaoh, Lord of the Two Houses. Your soldiers will leave His lands!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_get_military_off_my_land_01">My master's wishes are quite clear. Dread Pharaoh, in His hands the scourge and the rod, orders your troops to leave! NOW!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_begging_03">In Rome's name, be welcome, and speak in friendship! I will give a receptive ear to your words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_begging_02">For the Senate and People, be most welcome. Your words will find an attentive audience!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_begging_01">Be welcome! Let us talk, and then enjoy good Roman wine when we have agreement!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_begging_07">Your people's reputation goes before you. Find a welcome here, and speak as you wish.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_begging_06">Welcome, and let us be honoured by your attendance and your words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_begging_05">You will find me a willing and attentive audience for your speech. Give tongue to your words, and I will answer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_begging_04">Welcome, welcome, my friend. I will give ear to you, and give tongue to the Senate's words!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_begging_09">On behalf of the Senate, welcome. Speak, friend of Rome, and honour us all with wit and wisdom.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_begging_08">The gods bless us with your presence today. I will doubtless find pleasure in your wisdom here.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_accept_04">In Pharaoh's name, virility to His loins, I give assent to your proposal, and thanks for it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_reject_04">Were I to accept this offer, I would not sleep peacefully again. Such a fate would be uncomfortable.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_offer_demand_10">May Athena and your ancestors give you wise counsel here. They will, I am sure, remind you of many considerations…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_get_military_off_my_land_01">Your soldiers appear to have strayed into the lands of the Pharaoh, the master of the flood. Perhaps you could remove them soon?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_accept_05">Divine Pharaoh, brother and beloved of Isis, would have me agree to your proposal, of that I am sure!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_reject_05">The day draws on, and I cannot, for divine Pharaoh's part, give voice to any assent.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_get_military_off_my_land_02">Divine Pharaoh's dreams have been much disturbed of late because your warriors are in his lands. Please remove them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_accept_06">You speak well for your people, and my heart and head are persuaded. You have an agreement with Egypt!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_reject_06">No. Your speech is polite, but for Pharaoh, Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt, courtesy is not enough.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_get_military_off_my_land_03">There is much to be said for a warrior's life, but your warriors disturb our Egyptian peace. Remove them, please.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_player_join_confederation_01">Blood calls out to blood, and kin to kin. Be wise, and let us come together as one people for the good of all!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_accept_01">Your words are wise, and strike to the heart of our dealings. Pharaoh, strength and health to Him, will be pleased!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_reject_01">Your offer would never be pleasing to Pharaoh, the beloved of Isis, for He is wise beyond your mortal measure.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_player_join_confederation_03">The wolves run in the dark all around. You need the protection of your brothers, don't you?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_accept_02">I proudly speak for Pharaoh, Master of Upper and Lower Egypt, and give assent to your proposal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_reject_02">Your offer, weighed against the Feather of Truth, would be found wanting!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_player_join_confederation_02">We are children of the same gods! What sense is there in denying that we are one family?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_accept_03">Divine Pharaoh, master of my destiny, forgive me for the presumption of agreeing to this worthy offer!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_counter_reject_03">For divine Pharaoh's part I can reject this offer. He is an understanding lord, and will forgive my presumption.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_cancel_defensive_alliance">Cancel Defensive Alliance</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_trade_02">Our people have their own luxuries. They want no more trade with the likes of you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_trade_03">Trade between our lands will now end. Your merchants are as unwelcome as your coin. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_trade_01">There is a season when even the river of gold must run dry. That time has come upon us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_get_military_off_my_land_01">Your soldiers will leave our lands. You have no wish to see beneath the masks of our good natures!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_get_military_off_my_land_02">The omens have been heard! Your armies must leave our lands or risk catastrophe! So speak the seers!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_get_military_off_my_land_03">Your soldiers must leave. Leave, and quickly. There, it is said. And there is an end to the matter.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_single_payment_01">Rome does not ask much, merely a contribution towards her legions, those trusty guarantors of peace for all.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_single_payment_02">Some in the Senate are known to have lavish tastes. These men remember with fondness those who help fund such tastes.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_single_payment_03">Rome knows that wealth can be a burden. Will you not allow us to lighten your load a little?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_attack_faction_offer_01">The Pharaoh, who speaks with a voice of thunder, will order an attack on these people. Would this help?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_attack_faction_offer_03">Pharaoh, virility to Him and His line, offers warriors to attack these people. Do you accept His aid?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_attack_faction_offer_02">Mighty Pharaoh, who speaks only to the worthy, offers his many warriors in an attack against these people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_01">So be it. Did not Romulus and Remus go their separate ways?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_03">All paths diverge when travellers part company. Let us hope you do not fall prey to brigands on your road!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_02">Rome's shield should not lightly be put aside, but I will not say more: you are decided.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_05">We will end our arrangements. For your sake, let us hope that your gods still favour you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_04">Today, only enemies feel satisfaction at this turn of events in your dealings with Rome.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_06">As you wish, but sometimes folly is only seen as such long after the foolish act.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_peace_06">I ask for peace. Not for myself, but for my people, and in hope that the gods will favour peacemakers.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_trade_01">Hermes would surely bless you if trade between our peoples was allowed. Do not annoy the gods.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_peace_05">Even the strongest must put down the sword. Can you not see the time for peace has come?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_trade_02">You have many fine goods that many among us would enjoy. Can I not persuade you to trade with us?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_peace_04">I ask for peace. What glory is there in prolonging this war? What profit? What honour? Precious little.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_trade_03">Would you kindly allow trade between our people? The logic is clear. All would benefit, including your tax collectors!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_peace_03">It is time for an end to war. Your soldiers want to go home just as much as ours.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_peace_02">Hermes aid my tongue as I make this plea! Can we not have peace?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_beg_peace_01">I ask, with humility, as the gods would wish, that you end the suffering of my people, and this war.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_war_declaration_09">We have war. The board is ready, and the pieces in place. There is nothing else, except to die well.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_war_declaration_08">The bravery of men, not words, is all that is between us now. We shall have war, and victory!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_war_declaration_03">From Chaos we all sprang, and to nothingness you will return. We will see to it as your cities burn…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_war_declaration_02">Farewell, then. When next we meet I will give you blood for blood rather than pleasant words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_war_declaration_01">War! And an end to womanly peace! Most excellent! Ares favours us above all other races in battle!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_war_declaration_07">I have offered sacrifice to Ares in the hope of a short war, even though I yearn for your suffering!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_war_declaration_06">War against you is not enough, Tisiphone curse you! May all the Furies harry your folk thoughout the ages! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_war_declaration_05">We march, then, into an uncertain future. You and I may die, but that is unimportant. But your ruination matters…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_war_declaration_04">We shall have war, and poets will sing of it ten thousand years hence, when all else is forgotten!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_war_declaration_10">It is war, then. May the holy crocodiles grow bored with feasting on thy rotting carcasses!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_demanding_01">Though my Roman heart rightly cries out for more, I will do duty and accept your offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_demanding_03">I do not think the Senate will thank me greatly for this acceptance, but such is the lot of diplomats.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_demanding_02">Agreed, but I do not expect my fellow Romans to find much joy in this outcome.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_demanding_05">There could be more joy in this arrangement for Rome, but with honesty, we will keep to it. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_demanding_04">Such an offer creates a bitter taste but, on this occasion, Romans will wince and drink.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_demanding_06">The gods hardly smile at such a proposal, but yet Rome will hold to our words today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_single_payment_03">We offer this as a sign of accord reached, and new accords to come.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_single_payment_02">It is a simple gift, gold, but one that many appreciate, as we are sure you will.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_single_payment_01">In honour, I come bearing gifts. And why do you move away in such a fashion?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_single_payment_03">My people can only dream of wealth like yours. Can you not spare some for us?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_single_payment_02">We have simple needs. All we ask is a small amount of wealth. You will hardly notice it…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_single_payment_01">Gold, freely given and gratefully accepted, is a blessing from the gods to all involved. So say the bones…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_peace_01">I will speak the hardest word for a warrior: peace. It is an honourable offer, made to an honourable foe.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_factor_raiding">Raiding & Blockading </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_peace_03">I bring word that my lord looks to end the war. He will not look to end it another day.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_peace_02">We see little profit in further bloodshed. You have fought with honour, but it is time to staunch deep wounds.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_peace_05">My lord is willing to lay down the sword. It is not often that he is moved to mercy.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_trade_02">Let us trade. You surely will not turn aside from a road paved with gold?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_peace_04">The storm has raged long enough and now, at your agreement, the softer rains of peace could be yours.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_trade_03">You should welcome an offer of trade. Your lands will profit much by our merchants' attentions.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_peace_06">My lord offers you a peace. Tomorrow, his pre-occupation with this war may see him unleash further torments.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_trade_01">There is much virtue in wealth and profit for all, as you will surely see after a moment's thought.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_player_must_become_client_01">There is much wisdom in accepting the Senate and People of Rome as your new masters and protectors.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_player_must_become_client_03">Look forward to a life of comfort, justice and peace as a client of Rome and her mighty Gods!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_war_declaration_10">Now, you have time to joke about my people with your usual lack of wit. Before death takes to you…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_player_must_become_client_02">There is wisdom is accepting the rule of Rome, and the protection of the legions.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_war_declaration_05">As the dust of the desert you will be trampled by the gold-shod feet of the all-conquering Pharaoh!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_war_declaration_04">War! You will go screaming into the afterlife, sent by the armies of Pharaoh, the Captain of the Gods!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_war_declaration_07">The sands will cover your cities; your names will be forgotten. So speaks Pharaoh, noblest of all!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_war_declaration_06">Look to your souls, and make sure your foul gods judge you worthy of the afterlife! We will have war!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_war_declaration_01">The Pharaoh, the divine Horus reborn, will send your souls screaming into a dark afterlife!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_war_declaration_03">Prepare your tombs! Mighty Pharaoh, the lion of the Nile, will draw the sword and sheathe it in your entrails!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_war_declaration_02">May your shields and spears shatter! Mighty Pharaoh, his sword unsheathed in wrath, will widow your wives, and orphan your children!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_war_declaration_09">My lord, Pharaoh, he of the Two Egypts, will have war, and the inestimable pleasure of encompassing your doom!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_war_declaration_08">We are at war. Only when the jackals have finished feasting on your flesh will merciful Pharaoh be satisfied!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_peace_01">I can only speak in hope of moving you to mercy. We would have peace. What say you?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_peace_03">Sutekh has too long clouded all our minds. Now is the time for peace and an end to chaos…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_peace_02">Pharaoh, whose divine voice can give only pleasure to His listeners, earnestly wishes you to consider his offer of peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_peace_05">Let the wisdom of Thoth influence you now, as you harken to my sincere plea for peace!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_trade_02">Trade is a good thing between peoples, making both wealth and friendship. Will you not trade with Egypt?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_peace_04">Like the desert storm, our war should now blow itself out. This is the dearest wish of divine Pharaoh…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_trade_03">As the Nile rises to bring bounty, we should hope for a flood of trade between our lands!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_peace_06">Hear my words: divine Pharaoh, master of the Nile, would have peace with you. It is a worthy offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_trade_01">My lord Pharaoh, the giver of prosperity, asks you to consider your merchants' well-being. Let us have trade between our peoples.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_hand_over_region_01">My people would take it as a great kindness if you gave us these lands. And kindnesses are always remembered.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_hand_over_region_02">These lands have worth for my people. Please, let us make something of them and we will all surely prosper.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_hand_over_region_03">Please, hand over these lands to our care. The trees and spirits would have it so.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_defend_against_faction_01">The clouds are gathering and the wise man acts before the floods come. Can you aid our defence?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_defend_against_faction_02">Our defences need reinforcement. If we are conquered, how long until you are threatened directly?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_defend_against_faction_03">In the name of the Olympians I ask for your help against these hungry dogs. When can you send help?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_attack_faction_offer_01">The people of Carthage would gladly sweep these dung heaps from your path. Would this please you?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_attack_faction_offer_02">Carthage protects her friends from any and all enemies!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_attack_faction_offer_03">The generals of mighty Carthage would gladly stamp these worms into the dust!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_join_confederation_02">My people still have the strength to stand alone, and the stubbornness to reject such an offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_join_confederation_03">We are set in our ways, for they served us and our ancestors well. We cannot join with you.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_request_cooperation_01">We can agree here, if the spirits wish it, to proper treaties between our peoples. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_request_cooperation_03">The shield-wall is always stronger when brothers stand together. That is why I offer a treaty.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_request_cooperation_02">My ancestors have spoken well of you, and so we offer a treaty. The worthy make the best friends.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_offer_or_demand_defensive_alliance">Defensive Alliance</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_hand_over_region_01">I would not abandon a rabid dog to your rule, let alone the people of these lands!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_hand_over_region_03">I will not banish these people to a life of hopeless toil under your whips. Look elsewhere!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_hand_over_region_02">I know better than to leave the fate of so many in the hands of the deceitful, cruel and unworthy!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_war_01">War to the end, then. Ares will laugh as we slit your throats like tethered goats!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_war_02">I hope your people will long remember your name and give thanks for the suffering you inflict today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_war_03">Hera has surely turned her back on your land! Now you will feel the pain of fire and sword!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_war_04">War, then... I do not welcome it, but we will not flinch from sending every one of you to Hades!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_war_05">Diplomacy has failed, then, and wisdom is fled from the wits of men. I go now to find a sword…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_war_06">And so, then, to war. By-the-by, leave your best goods in plain sight. It makes looting so much easier.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_war_07">And so all false friendship falls away and we have war. It is good, for once, to see honesty.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_war_08">By Athena's perfect backside! I am invigorated at the very thought of ridding the world of you people!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_war_09">Very well, we have war. Start saving your money, for you will need much coin to pay the ferryman.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_defensive_alliance_warning">End Defensive Alliance||Do you want to end your defensive alliance with this faction?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_regular_payment_01">While Pharaoh, blessed be His beard, expects all to bow before him, he is willing to forgive discourtesy in exchange for regular tribute.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_regular_payment_03">In lesser men a request for money might be grasping; in the case of Pharaoh, the just, it is only proper.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_regular_payment_02">Your cause would be much advanced if you gave Pharaoh, the merciful and wise, regular tribute.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_war_10">We are at war. May you suffer a thousand curses, and a thousand more as payment for this folly!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_reject_03">No. No. I think that the Senate's deliberations should not be troubled with your words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_reject_02">"Ha! This particular ""Vestal virgin"" will keep virtue and worth, despite your cunning tongue!"</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_reject_01">Your honeyed words and offers ring false to honest Roman ears.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_reject_07">I have generously given time and ear to these words, but I cannot agree with their import.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_reject_06">There is little worth in the these terms for Rome. I cannot agree with you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_reject_05">I do not think the Senate would countenance such an agreement. Therefore, consider it refused.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_reject_04">This proposal need not occupy the Senators' attention. You have said little of worth and I reject your offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_reject_09">Ha! I know the Senate would laugh at such an offer, therefore I will laugh at it too!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_reject_08">I struggle to find merit in your words. Rome cannot agree to your offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_attack_faction_offer_02">My warlike people will set upon these jackals without mercy if you send the word!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_attack_faction_offer_03">These are feeble dogs. Say it, and we will have them skinned before the next moon!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_attack_faction_offer_01">Do you require help against these scum? We see much profit in such a course of action.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_receive_requesting_09">Speak friend, and I will share your words with the people of Carthage.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_receive_requesting_08">The people of Carthage welcome honest men and honest talk.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_receive_requesting_01">What do you wish to discuss?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_receive_requesting_03">Carthage welcomes you! You have our rapt attention.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_receive_requesting_02">I welcome you on behalf of the people of Carthage: speak, friend.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_receive_requesting_05">Be welcome and sit, we have much to discuss.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_receive_requesting_04">Today is a good day to discuss topics of mutual benefit.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_receive_requesting_07">May Ba'al Hammon look kindly on our meeting this day.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_receive_requesting_06">Welcome! I am eager to hear your words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_military_access_02">Our lands would never be rid of the stench. You may not march in them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_military_access_03">Your armies are not fit to march where our gods still live. You pollute their peace by even asking!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_military_access_01">The gods and our ancestors long dead would strangle us in the night if we allowed such a stupidity!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_war_10">War! Excellent! In ferrying your dead to the afterlife, Charon will be busier than a temple prostitute at Carthage!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_regular_payment_03">We are not given to nice hypocrisies: if you wish our good opinion, then you must pay for it. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_regular_payment_02">I offer only our kind thoughts, but these are weighed and measured in your gold. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_regular_payment_01">Those who offer gold often receive the favour of powerful people, such as I serve.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_war_08">Pharaoh, Lord of Many Armies, welcomes your war, and keenly anticipates His future pleasures with your wives!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_war_09">Very well, we will have war. Fools! Pharaoh, mightiest of commanders, unsheathes his sword today!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_war_06">May your sword rust, your shield shatter, and your sword arm wither! We are ready for your war!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_war_07">War? Only the jackals and carrion birds will thank you for this foolishness!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_war_04">You show your true mettle. We will meet you in battle, and Pharaoh, all-wise and kind, will review your corpses.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_war_05">By this act the days of peace are over. In the name of Pharaoh, mighty monarch of all, be accursed!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_war_02">So war comes. Know this: the kites will circle for you, not the noble sons of Egypt!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_war_03">For your honesty, my thanks. As to the coming war, you have my ill wishes and curses in abundance!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_war_01">Very well. War it will be! The great Pharaoh's army, may His sword stay sharp, will not rest while you live!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_cooperation_01">The friendships of nations are not the same as the friendship of men. Nations do not grieve for absent comrades.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_cooperation_03">By the flame, the bonds between us must be broken. The gods have seen no single path for us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_cooperation_02">I hesitate only because I do not wish to add hurt. But you must now look to your own defence.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_cooperation_05">From this day all treaties are broken, all agreements void, all understandings… misunderstood. So speaks my lord.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_cooperation_04">We can no longer stand with you in peace and war. Such is the way of men. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_cooperation_06">Like the caravan of merchants that has crossed a desert, it is time for us to go our separate ways.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_angry_10">I am a civilized man. I promise you civilized and excruciating pain for what you have offered… But not death.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_regular_payment_03">Divine Pharaoh, from whom all wealth flows, has no need of your coin in his treasury.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_regular_payment_02">Pharaoh, blessed of Osiris, is minded refuse your humble offer of mortal wealth.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_regular_payment_01">Your offer is well meant, but you only embarrass yourself. Pharaoh, strength be His, does not sell His friendship.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_cancel_nonaggression_pact">Cancel Non-Aggression Pact</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_payment">Payments</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_not_interested_in_further_discussion_01">I must away, we have discussed much and achieved nothing.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_not_interested_in_further_discussion_03">We Carthaginians are not renowned for tolerance of fools. Enough.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_not_interested_in_further_discussion_02">Get out of my sight! I fear your stupidity may be catching!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_not_interested_in_further_discussion_05">Silence now! I am drowning in your pointless prattle!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_not_interested_in_further_discussion_04">Ba'al Hammon save me from witless worms!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_not_interested_in_further_discussion_06">I have suffered through your clumsy speech for long enough! Be done!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_break_hard_military_access">Break Military Access...</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_begging_10">I speak with the voice of the Senate, and am ordered to offer their felicitations at this meeting!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_cooperation_06">I humbly propose this in the hope that you will see the merit of closer ties with our people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_cooperation_04">My lord would have me propose a treaty between us. I will go further, and humbly request such a thing.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_cooperation_05">Have not omens shown that the gods will welcome a treaty? Do not offend the gods, I beg you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_cooperation_02">Your people are widely admired and I humbly request that you consider us suitable for a treaty.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_cooperation_03">I propose, or rather ask for, a treaty to combine our forces with your considerable strength.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_cooperation_01">We beg for a treaty between our peoples, some arrangement that will give us both prosperity and strength.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_military_access_02">Do not give Pharaoh, the fount of kindness, reason to frown. Let our troops into your lands!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_military_access_03">It is simple: allow our troops to march through your lands, on pain of Pharaoh's divine displeasure!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_military_access_01">Mighty Pharaoh, commander of all beneath the heavens, rightly instructs that his troops should march across your lands!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_attack_faction_01">These people are concerning. Will you not move your armies against them? When can you give the orders?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_attack_faction_02">We find ourselves matched against a worthy foe. Your strength would be a great comfort. Can you attack?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_attack_faction_03">These people are a danger. Your generals are well placed to trample these insolent wretches. Can you do this?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_01">I am deeply flattered that you would give such a gift to Rome and her people. Our thanks.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_03">Rome will accept your gift, and give thanks to you and your gods.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_02">This is a most fitting and generous gift. Rome does not forget such generous friends.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_01">The soldiers of Pharaoh, the lion of the desert, will leave your lands as soon as possible.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_03">If the soldiers of Pharaoh, all might be His, are not welcome, they will leave.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_02">My Lord Pharaoh, gentlest yet strongest of rulers, will remove his troops as you request.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_angry_01">No, I will never agree! Not even if you were to drag me behind a camel to far Indus!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_06">Betray my people into a treaty with your kind? Shall I also befriend sharks, rancid squid and week-old dung?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_angry_03">I should have your flayed skin nailed back onto your twitching carcass for such insolence! Instead, I will smile, slightly, at your wit…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_04">What a splendid notion! And I shall break my spear and shatter my hoplon before going into battle too! Bah!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_angry_02">"Ah! You think me a fool blinded by the love of gold, and with sun-addled brains. The answer is ""No!"""</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_05">A man is judged by the friends he chooses. I do not choose you, foreigner.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_angry_05">Take care. Fan the flames of my anger and you will enjoy the red-hot pincers of a reply…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_02">Your friendship is as much use as a broken oar at sea! Keep it to yourselves!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_angry_04">So, you think me a child then, to make such an offer? Remember children have nasty tempers, and sharp teeth!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_03">This perverse, impudent proposal mocks dignity, and the gods! Have you no sense of your place in the world?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_angry_07">I wonder, will you smile at your own wit if we cut off your lips and eyelids?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_angry_06">There are many holes in the desert, and many problems in those holes, my problematic friend.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_01">If Plato, of blessed memory, is right, somewhere there is a perfect and entirely stupid version of you, isn't there?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_angry_09">Mithra's brazen bulls! The gods gave you a fool's face, a fool's wit and an extremely tiny manhood!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_angry_08">There is a man in my entourage who collects... parts of insolent fellows. Do you wish to meet him?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_regular_payment_01">Mighty Pharaoh, in His wisdom, is prepared to generously grant you a pension drawn from his wealth.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_regular_payment_03">I must be plain, I think. Egypt's coffers, well stuffed with coin, will vomit wealth on you, if you wish…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_regular_payment_02">I will speak plainly about money: divine Pharaoh, in his wealth, would bless you with coin from time to time…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_defensive_alliance">Defensive Alliance</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_begging_08">I wish to speak to you of matters of mutual benefit, although in truth, I think you benefit most!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_begging_09">The Senate sends greetings to you, a most worthy diplomat for your people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_begging_02">Salutations and friendship from the Senate and People of Rome, and a proposal for your august consideration!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_begging_03">In the name of Rome, honoured greetings unto you. I am sent to speak for the People and the Senate.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_begging_01">From the Senate and People of Rome, greetings to our noble friends, and words of great joy to come!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_begging_06">Rome and the Senate graciously extend their greetings and good wishes. Now, to business.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_defend_against_faction_offer_01">The armies of Carthage will come to your aid, just say the word.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_begging_07">Your people are well known in Rome for honesty and manly virtue. That is why I have been sent.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_defend_against_faction_offer_02">Do you require assistance? Carthage is always happy to help.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_begging_04">Salutations and joyous greetings to you, honoured friend of Rome! I have words to speak.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_defend_against_faction_offer_03">Carthage and her armies stand ready to march!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_begging_05">Greetings, good friend of Rome, greetings. Let us speak our parts and find agreement!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_requesting_09">The gods will have me listen to you, but do not pass the day in words without merit.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_requesting_08">I welcome you, worthy speaker. I listen because your people are known to have honour.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_requesting_07">Greetings, friend. We will speak together of whatever you wish, but bring words that can warm our hearts.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_peace_06">This war no longer benefits either side. Let us have peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_trade_01">Greetings honoured friends! Carthage seeks trade with your people!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_requesting_06">Greetings, speak plainly and without idle purpose and all will be well. The sure thrust strikes home, after all.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_requesting_05">A flapping tongue that speaks without wisdom is not welcome. Be like a spear, and have a point! Ha!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_peace_04">Peace would be best for everyone, do you not agree?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_trade_03">The people of Carthage love trade! We would share our love with you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_requesting_04">We will gladly listen to your offers, but do not to wrap them in lies. The spirits know truth.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_peace_05">Ba'al Hammon has tasted enough flesh. Now is the time for peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_trade_02">Trade benefits all involved! So, let us begin!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_requesting_03">You are welcome, although my ancestors and people expect talk with purpose and honesty.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_peace_02">I come before you seeking peace for the people of Carthage.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_requesting_02">Well met, friend! Sit, and let your words move me to anger or agreement, as you wish of them!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_peace_03">Have we not suffered enough? Let us have peace!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_requesting_01">Greetings. Now, speak plainly, for we are an honest folk and value honesty in others.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_peace_01">Carthage tires of this pointless war, and we would have peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_cancel_treaty_non_aggression_pact">They have ended their non-aggression pact with you</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_cancel_treaty_client_state">They have ended their client state pact with you</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_single_payment_01">Obedience and honesty are treasured in Rome, but so too is gold, given freely, and often.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_single_payment_03">While Rome has no claim to your wealth, perhaps goodwill leads to sharing. The Gods would surely approve.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_single_payment_02">Rome values friendship, and looks forward to receiving gold in abundance as a token of goodwill.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_not_interested_in_further_discussion_01">The day has been long. I think dinner is more likely to bring me satisfaction than bandying further words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_not_interested_in_further_discussion_02">The Pharaoh, wisdom and fertility unto Him, would have me say this: we have talked too long, to no purpose.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_not_interested_in_further_discussion_03">Maat preserve me! Are you still speaking? That I was asleep is token of my interest in further talk…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_not_interested_in_further_discussion_04">Sutekh rules your heart and tongue! We have talked and talked and talked, of much and nothing. We are done.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_not_interested_in_further_discussion_05">Enough, I pray! I must find a crocodile to bite off my head, for it buzzes with too much talk!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_not_interested_in_further_discussion_06">The day is fled away in talk. My tongue is as dry as the desert, while my bladder prays for mercy!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_regular_payment_02">I fear that this generous gift may mask your true intentions. No.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_regular_payment_03">Carthage must decline your generous offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_regular_payment_01">The people of Carthage do not need your gold.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_begging_10">May Hermes bless us both with skilful tongues that we may speak our parts well, and so reach agreement!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_begging_04">Welcome, friend-to-be of Pharaoh, the Master of Two Houses! Speak now of your desires.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_begging_05">Greetings, friend foreigner, greetings. Speak, and I will hear your words for Pharaoh, Lord of the Nile.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_begging_06">Pharaoh, the light of His people, bids me welcome you and listen carefully and respectfully to your embassy.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_begging_07">You honour me with your worthy presence. I am but a humble servant of Pharaoh, lord of all true men.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_begging_01">The blessings of the Pharaoh, most wise and loving, appropriate to your station as a foreigner, be upon you and our meeting.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_begging_02">Be most welcome, friend of Pharaoh, fertility to His manhood and strength to His sword arm! Approach and speak!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_begging_03">Pharaoh, Master of the Nile, blesses our meeting and wishes all to speak truth so that agreement is reached!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_begging_08">I bid you a hearty welcome. Let nothing here displease you. Enjoy the pleasures that an Egyptian can offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_begging_09">I will listen with all respect to the words you speak, and give divine Pharaoh's fair answer to them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_get_military_off_my_land_01">I will speak plainly of the Senate's wishes: remove your troops. Immediately.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_get_military_off_my_land_03">The Senate demands that your warriors leave our lands. We have fine roads to the borders: use them!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_get_military_off_my_land_02">I must be direct: the Senate and the People can no longer stomach your troops on Roman lands. Remove them!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_cancel_military_access_02">Divine Pharaoh, beloved and brother of Isis, has been disturbed by your armies in his lands. The borders are closed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_cancel_military_access_03">Pharaoh, lord of the river and the desert, orders that all borders are now closed to your armies.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_receive_requesting_10">Greetings to you! I trust you come with honourable words that I can hear kindly.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_cancel_military_access_01">Pharaoh, blessed is His breath, instructs that His welcome should no longer be extended to foreign armies.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_03">What you ask will never come to pass! Never!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_02">Carthaginians do not bow to anyone!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_01">The people of Carthage will never be slaves!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_cooperation_01">Co-operation between our people would be wise.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_cooperation_02">We have seen your worth and come  to offer you a treaty.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_cooperation_03">Worthy friend! A treaty between our people would benefit all involved!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_cooperation_04">Any alliance between us would strike fear into the hearts of our enemies and rivals.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_defend_against_faction_offer_01">The Pharaoh, the Lord of Armies and Lion of the Desert, offers you help against these creatures.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_cooperation_05">The friendship of mighty Carthage is worth more than all the gold in the East.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_request_cooperation_06">We should unite by treaty; none could stand before our combined might!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_defend_against_faction_offer_03">If you wish, Pharaoh, the Lord of the Nile, will come to your defence as swift the river's flood!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_defend_against_faction_offer_02">Do you want our help against these folk? The armies of Pharaoh, the lion of the desert, stand ready.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_begging_09">Athena give you wisdom, so that you may speak well, and persuade me of your cause! Be welcome!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_begging_02">Welcome, welcome! In a spirit of Olympian hospitality, I welcome you, and will listen with care.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_begging_03">I am eager to hear your embassy, inspired as it undoubtedly is by the wit and wisdom of Athena herself!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_begging_01">I am honoured to receive you, and look forward to your erudite arguments and witty quips!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_begging_06">Greetings, honoured guest! I serve as my people's ears and tongue, listening and speaking as will please…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_begging_07">I give you welcome. Let Zeus and all the gods smile upon our meeting, so that all may profit!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_get_military_off_my_land_01">The Senate sends word that your warriors must leave Roman territory. For now, they ask in friendship and with courtesy.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_begging_04">The blessing of the Olympians upon you! What, then, do your noble people desire of us?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_get_military_off_my_land_02">In the name of Rome, I ask that you remove your warriors, who appear to have strayed into our lands, doubtless by mistake…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_begging_05">I am honoured to greet such an ambassador of such worthy people. My ears… tingle… with anticipation!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_get_military_off_my_land_03">Even the most welcome guests grow wearisome. Rome requests you take your armies off our lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_begging_10">Speak, and this humble servant of great Pharaoh will listen. If I can, I will agree to your proposals…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_01">Carthage will do as you bid, and march our troops to more profitable purposes.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_02">As you say. The warriors of Carthage have places to go and people to see.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_03">If the people of Carthage are no longer welcome they shall go elsewhere.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_cancel_treaty_player">Your have ended a treaty with this faction</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_accept_01">Your words are wise, and the Senate will find much satisfaction in hearing them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_reject_01">The Senate would rightly question my moon-struck stupidity if I accepted such a proposal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_accept_03">I accept! The Gods, the Senate and all of Rome will welcome your wisdom. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_reject_03">I will speak as our noble Senators would desire and, finding little worth in your words, decline.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_accept_02">I will give voice to the Senate acceptance of your proposal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_reject_02">An eagle flew around my head three times on my way here! Consider your offer rejected!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_accept_05">The Gods are pleased by your words. Rome and the Senate will be satisfied.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_reject_05">I cannot. I dare not! Rome would rightly close her gates in my face were I to accept.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_accept_04">With such an arrangement, you and your people show honour to rival that of any modest Roman.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_reject_04">The Senate's collective will is clear in this matter, and your proposal has little worthy of agreement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_accept_06">So it is done! I almost heard the Senate murmur with approval at this outcome.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_counter_reject_06">I fear acceptance will not find a home in my heart. Rome will not accept such an arrangement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_single_payment_01">A little gold would make the people of Carthage very happy.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_peace_03">I offer an arrangement that will bring rest to our swords and an end to suffering.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_peace_02">The arrows of war have missed their targets. Now, perhaps, it is time to talk of peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_single_payment_03">Your coffers are fit to burst, surely you can spare some gold for Carthage?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_peace_01">Camels spit and squabble at each other, but men are not camels. We can have peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_single_payment_02">We humbly request a small amount of gold for the coffers of Carthage.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_peace_06">We can carry on war's slaughter. Only our rivals will profit by that. Or we can have peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_trade_01">Trade is the gateway to prosperity. Will you not pass within?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_peace_05">War has waxed and waned, a bloody moon over our lands. Now it is time for the sun to rise.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_trade_02">Your people, although they do not know it yet, will find our merchandise most wondrous! Why deny them?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_peace_04">We have all made a desert of men's hopes, and not profited by it. Perhaps it is time for peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_trade_03">Our merchants are welcomed across all the world for the wealth they bring! Why should your lands be any different?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_payment_on_table_tooltip_ai_side">You'll receive this payment if the deal gets accepted.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_factor_friendly_towards_friends_positive">Friendly actions towards friends</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_defend_against_faction_offer_02">These swinish people will threaten us soon enough, so my lord offers armies to cull the herd…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_defend_against_faction_offer_03">Your armies stand at risk. We have troops who could help. That is the thrust of my offer here.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_defend_against_faction_offer_01">My lord's men stand ready. Do you need aid against these people? Speak, and it will be yours!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_military_alliance_warning">End Military Alliance||Do you want to end your military alliance with this faction? </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_regular_payment_02">We are not greedy but we could see you as most worthy if you contribute to our treasure-stores.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_regular_payment_03">Gold aplenty is a comfort to anyone. We would think well of you if you were to give some small coins…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_regular_payment_01">My lord's needs are simple, and could be easily met with payments every so often. To suit you, naturally…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_angry_07">May your tongue wither and die!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_angry_06">You are lower than any creature of the earth! We will never agree!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_angry_05">Ba'al Hammon, take this insolent pup and teach him to fear his masters!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_angry_04">O! Would that I could add your lying tongue to my collection!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_angry_03">I should flay you where you stand!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_angry_02">If I were not a representative of the noble people of Carthage I would rip out your heart!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_angry_01">Curse you to the furthest reaches of the Great Waste!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_angry_09">Your words are like poison and I am not fool enough to drink!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_angry_08">Creature of darkness! I reject any and all words that fall from your mouth!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_trade_01">Your newly impoverished merchants will, I am certain, offer thanks to your gods for what you have done!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_trade_03">Our Roman merchants will be displeased to lose coin. But they are Romans, and used to hardship.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_trade_02">The Senate is seldom interested in trade. It is… sordid and unworthy of their nobility.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_current_treaty_client_of_non_player">You are a client state of this faction ||You're under their protection and in exchange send them a sum of money as a tribute every turn. Tribute you pay them per turn: %n</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_military_access_03">Our lands cannot host your armies. The way must be closed, and our people given peace and quiet.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_military_access_02">The sun is clouded when your armies march in our lands. Apollo is troubled. Your armies must go.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_military_access_01">Our gates have stood open too long. Your armies are no longer welcome in our lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_not_interested_in_further_discussion_06">By the flame! We have talked but now I lock the gates of my ears to your speech!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_not_interested_in_further_discussion_05">My lord does not tolerate his servants wasting time in endless talk. We are finished.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_not_interested_in_further_discussion_04">Gossip and chit-chat are all very well for old women at the well, but I have better things to do!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_not_interested_in_further_discussion_03">Our words have flopped about like fish out of water, but have given us nothing to gnaw upon.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_not_interested_in_further_discussion_02">I can listen no more! The day is nearly done. Bring me wine and women, and no more words!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_not_interested_in_further_discussion_01">Enough! My mind is weary with chatter. The wine grows stale, and it was not of the best anyway.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_angry_10">Ba'al Hammon grant me the strength not to destroy this fool and his kind! No!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_02">Our armies will march away. By my heart, you will be poorer when their magnificence is gone!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_angry_get_military_off_my_land_03">The presence of your puny forces on Roman land has caused offence in the Senate! Remove them!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_03">You will have your wish. My lord will order the withdrawal immediately. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_angry_get_military_off_my_land_02">You try Roman patience too far! Remove your foul little armies from our lands immediately!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_angry_get_military_off_my_land_01">Remove your filth from Roman lands. March away. Do not come again. So speaks the Senate, and all of Rome!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_01">Very well. Our soldiers will leave, if that is truly your desire. They were, I thought, helping your ruffians!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_angry_06">Gods of Egypt! Grant me the strength to spare this idiot from an unmarked desert grave! I will never agree!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_angry_07">No! May a thousand scorpions nest in your living entrails for this impudence to Pharaoh, the mighty and merciful!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_angry_08">If a camel spoke your words, I would marvel. That you have spoken so is token only of insolence.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_military_access_01">Certainly not. We cannot agree to your soldiers tramping all over our vineyards and olive groves.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_military_access_02">A man may open his door to a friend, but all the friend's servants are a different matter.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_military_access_03">My friend, you would march through, and over, and back, and forwards, until our land was your land. So, no.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_regular_payment_02">Our lands have riches beyond imagining, which is why we can afford to share some of our good fortune.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_regular_payment_03">My master insists that friends be treated well. Your treasury, he notes, lacks gold…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_regular_payment_01">If you will allow me a small joke, I trust that your treasurer will not mind counting the money! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_military_access_03">Ares has shown the way for our soldiers. Now, do not defy the gods by refusing passage through your lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_military_access_02">We wish our armies to march across your lands. I am sure that this will cause you no problems.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_military_access_01">Our armies seek passage. Allow it, and so increase my people's good opinion of you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_attack_faction_01">My master instructs me to ask that you attack these people. Would you refuse Pharaoh, kin of the Gods?</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_attack_faction_02">Attack these people, and the favour of the Gods, in divine Pharaoh's good wishes, will go with you!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_cooperation_01">In the name of Pharaoh, the all-wise, I humbly ask that we reach some kind of permanent agreement here today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_regular_payment_01">My friend, our coffers already overflow with wealth from all corners of the world. We need no more!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_cooperation_03">As an Egyptian I am unused to begging, but I will beg for a treaty if that is required…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_regular_payment_02">Your intent here is plain, but to accept your money would put us, ever-so-slightly, in your debt.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_cooperation_02">I would hurl myself into the Nile floods if that would serve in reaching an agreement today!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_regular_payment_03">My people have riches enough. Your gesture is polite, but not needed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_cooperation_05">Consider carefully my offer: divine Pharaoh, heir of Osiris, offers formal friendship to you…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_cooperation_04">I call upon Shu to aid us in our deliberations, bringing calm so that we may have a treaty today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_beg_cooperation_06">I can only speak in honesty and hope: mighty Pharaoh sends me to ask for a treaty between our peoples.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_defensive_alliance_tooltip">Defensive allies are sworn to protect each other if war is declared. It is useful to be on friendly terms with a faction before requesting an alliance.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_cancel_trade_02">There was no honour in swapping baubles anyway. Real men trade blows, if only in the practice circle!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_cancel_trade_01">Our traders will look elsewhere for wealth, and trouble you no more. Have yours do the same.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_defend_against_faction_02">There is no time for argument. Pharaoh, strength to his sword arm, expects your troops to march against these people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_defend_against_faction_03">This is the time for you to show your quality. Every Egyptian general expects your aid against these people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_demanding_10">I like an axe or sword better than weak words, so you would do well to agree today!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_defend_against_faction_01">My lord Pharaoh, Commander of Celestial Hosts, insists that your armies, no matter how feeble, defend against these people!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_hand_over_region_01">But handing over these lands would deprive the people of the rule of Pharaoh, the all-wise and mighty!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_hand_over_region_02">Pharaoh, who sweetens the air with His presence, cannot hand over his servants to cruel, foreign masters.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_hand_over_region_03">If Pharaoh, friend of justice, did such a thing, could justice live on in Egypt?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_defend_against_faction_01">Such a scheme is indeed excellent, but we must let you mount a glorious and successful defence!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_defend_against_faction_03">You must stand alone. Our armies, I find, exist more in the treasurer's accounts than reality…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_defend_against_faction_02">Our swords are blunted, and our armies in need of drill. We cannot come to your defence.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_military_access_01">My lord and master asks for his troops to pass through your lands, unhindered and without causing offence.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_10">I had heard that you were as wearisome as a stubborn camel, yet this is not even slightly true!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_reject_10">I trust that you can face your gods without them visiting you with boils after this…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_military_access_02">Our armies seek a route through your lands. They will act with respect and good order.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_military_access_03">We have need for our armies to pass through your lands. Will you agree to this humble request?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_get_military_off_my_land_02">Your warriors can march in our lands no longer. The spirits have spoken clearly on this matter. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_get_military_off_my_land_03">We have been quiet for a long time, but now it is time for your warriors to go home. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_get_military_off_my_land_01">Our gods grow weary of your soldiers' tread! As you value friendship, remove your men from our lands.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_not_interested_in_further_discussion_06">I am tired of talk. I want good wine, olives, fresh bread, a baked fish and a very naughty hierodoule!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_not_interested_in_further_discussion_01">Olives have withered on the tree while we talked and talked. It is time to stop before the trees wither!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_not_interested_in_further_discussion_03">You know, it is time to stop talking. I stopped listening many hours ago and thought about beautiful women instead!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_not_interested_in_further_discussion_02">Speak no more! You do not argue your case before Aeacus and his fellows. Being mortal, I need easement!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_defend_against_faction_02">You ask too much of Pharaoh, the protector and spirit of Egypt. He cannot send help.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_defend_against_faction_03">The many forces of Pharaoh, who improves the world with His every deed, are otherwise committed at present.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_defend_against_faction_01">Such a course may seem wise, but Pharaoh, the Shield of Egypt, thinks differently and will commit no forces.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_defend_against_faction_03">It is simple. Move your armies to aid us. Or have the world think you poor friends and weaklings.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_defend_against_faction_02">We expect loyalty from friends at a time of need. We expect your armies to march to our aid.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_06">A wise choice. Why lead your people through the mountains when a straight road lies ahead?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_07">You serve your people with honour and will surely win the favour of your gods.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_reject_07">I hear and honour your judgement my friend, even if its wisdom escapes me…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_04"> An excellent decision! Your head masters your passion with wisdom.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_reject_04">I fear you have turned your people from a path of prosperity and sent them towards misfortune.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_05">Your acceptance is welcome. My people, my master and the gods will all be pleased. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_reject_05">Ah! An unwise, even foolish, choice but we respect your… independence… of thought.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_02">Your wisdom in this matter is a credit to your people, better than any golden coin!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_reject_02">I think that many will regret your choice. Let us hope that regrets come singly, not like Roman legions!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_03">Ah, my friend, if the wisdom you possess were golden treasure, you could buy the known world!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_reject_03">I see that your course is set. Truly, I hope your gods gave you wisdom and not false counsel.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_01">Ah! So you know how to haggle and when to stop! An offer accepted is a blessing to all!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_reject_01">We have driven too hard a bargain or haggled overlong, it seems. Very well, your decision is made.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_08">Your heart and love for your people guide you well today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_reject_08">Your lack of acceptance is disappointing, but the camel will not hear that roast goat is delicious.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_03">So be it, the armies of mighty Carthage will no longer grace your lands with their presence. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_09">You have proven a worthy negotiator. All will rejoice at this outcome.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_reject_09">I thought more of you and your people. But your choice is made, and now you must live with it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_02">The armies of Carthage will leave your lands, if that is truly what you wish.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_attack_faction_03">These brazen fools deserve only death. Can your mighty generals take the butcher's blade to them?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_attack_faction_02">We ask only a little: turn your mighty fist against this most annoying of foes!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_attack_faction_01">I respectfully ask for an attack on these people, as soon as can be arranged..</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_hand_over_region_01">The Senate would have me thrown from the Tarpeian Rock for even listening to this hare-brained suggestion. And you with me!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_hand_over_region_02">I have no wish to be hurled from the Tarpeian Rock, thank you. I will never commit treachery by agreeing!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_hand_over_region_03">This is insanity! Rome will not loosen her grip on any lands for you! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_accept_requesting_05">These are good terms, we are happy to accept.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_defend_against_faction_offer_01">A wise man helps his friends in times of trouble. Do you need an extra sword against these people?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_defend_against_faction_offer_02">The phalanx only stands when all do their part as brothers. Do you need our help against your enemy?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_accept_requesting_06">We accept these terms with open arms and open hearts.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_defend_against_faction_offer_03">Why have you not looked to your friends for help against these people? We stand ready!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_accept_requesting_01">I go now to sacrifice to Ba'al Hammon, thanking him for his aid in bringing accord today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_accept_requesting_03">The people of Carthage will be pleased.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_accept_requesting_02">Carthage has heard your terms and found them agreeable.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_offer_or_demand_trade_access">Trade Agreement</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_begging_08">I am thankful that I have your ear, and hope that I can speak the right words to please you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_begging_09">I have been chosen by my people as a tongue for their words. Hear me, then, with honesty…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_begging_01">In the names of our people and our gods, greetings to our honoured friends!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_begging_02">I came to unlock my word-hoard, and share wisdom at your table and, perhaps, reach agreement. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_begging_03">Greetings! May our mighty gods lend wisdom to my speech, and patience to your hearing!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_begging_04">You are most worthy for listening to my words, spoken in hope, for my people. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_begging_05">I bring the blessings of my gods and my people. All look favourably upon you today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_begging_06">May the gods bless your patience and give me words that will gain your agreement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_begging_07">You honour me with your attention. I hope my words will be heard with kindness.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_09">You have an honest tongue, and so I reject your offer hesitantly, and without wishing offence.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_08">The gods would be displeased if I said yes too easily, although you speak your part well. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_01">You speak well but I fear the spirits do not approve. I cannot go against such portents. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_begging_05">Rome embraces this and the virtues of your fine people. This is a day of progress!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_01">Perhaps the gods have decided your people no longer deserve life? Have you considered that?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_begging_04">Though Roman dignity is undoubtedly affronted by this offer, I reluctantly accept.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_03">Your people are a byword for honour, but I cannot quite accept the terms that you offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_02">We are not moved by the plight of your people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_02">Our gods whisper to me that I must reject your offer, worthy though it was, and hope for something more.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_03">Carthage will not come to your aid, coward!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_begging_06">Your words are loaded with wisdom and foresight. The Senate will truly see you in a favourable light.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_05">I fear our ancestors' unhappiness if I accepted, generous as your offer seems.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_begging_01">Your words have Roman honesty about them, and are fair and just. I willingly accept your offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_04">You speak from deep wisdom although the offer is but shallow. I cannot agree.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_07">I cannot settle on such terms. Your people are worthy, but my people deserve better of our talk.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_begging_03">I will recommend your worthy proposal to the Senate. We are agreed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_06">I cannot agree, even though the ale calls and the food smells most excellent.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_accept_begging_02">Jupiter be praised! Let Him bless your wise words and our agreement today!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_regular_payment_02">We did not talk in the hopes of being bought and sold. Therefore, you have my refusal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_regular_payment_03">Perhaps only a fool would say no to your wealth. So: I will be counted among fools…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_regular_payment_01">My thanks, but also my refusal. Your gold is not needed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_begging_10">Greetings and blessings of my ancestors! I have much to say, if you will but listen…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_01">Our soldiers will march away. By Ares, I trust that this will not invite enemies to your gates!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_02">We will withdraw. Let us hope you have no need for the immediate help of friends.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_03">Our generals will march out of your lands. They will not return. We honour our commitments.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_10">You speak as well as a bard, but I must be unswayed by all except the interest of my people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_offer_or_demand_state_gift_single_payment">Payments (Gift)</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_client_status_01">Our gods would weep, and rightly, to see us give up our freedom and become your dogs.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_client_status_02">I will not offer up my people as sacrifices to your glory. Ancestors! Strike me down if I ever do!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_client_status_03">I will never as my people to bow to you. Never. Our hard-won freedom remains ours!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_03">I am sent by my master to speak on matters of some importance to us both.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_02">Greetings! I come to speak for my master, and trust that the Gods will breathe wisdom into all who listen!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_01">I come as an emissary, bringing greetings and a proposal to our mutual profit.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_07">I speak the words of a master renowned for honesty and fair dealing. You are worthy of his words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_06">I seek acceptance for terms that will surely bring progress to all our lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_05">Greetings, friend. I bring a treasure of words that will surely find favour with your people. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_04">I welcome this chance to speak, for I think you will find what I say is of much interest…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_03">Your trouble me, but we will do as you ask. Our warriors will go another way.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_02">As you wish. Our warriors will find other paths and not trouble you or your homely women again.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_01">So be it. Your lands are yours alone once more. Let us hope there is wisdom in this.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_09">Well met! I speak, the devoted servant of my people, to one who we would name a friend.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_08">I thank you for this audience. You should find the words I bring more than interesting.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_single_payment_01">I hope that this offer of coins will be taken in the right spirit of comradeship and respect!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_single_payment_03">My lord wishes to bestow coin on your people. Accept it as a token of friendship.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_single_payment_02">Take this subsidy. Our treasuries were over-full!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_attack_faction_02">The time for talk is over. In dread Pharaoh's name, I demand that your armies march on these people!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_attack_faction_03">Pharaoh, Master of the Nile, is quite clear: he expects you to attack these insolent dogs immediately.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_attack_faction_01">The Lord of the Two Egypts, mighty Pharaoh, insists that an attack be made.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_01">I accept in the name of our people. Let this be a sign of more good to come.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_02">Your offer is fair and honourable. I swear by the gods that, for our part, all will be as we have agreed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_03">You have spoken fairly, and I can accept for my people knowing that good will come of the day.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_04">I can sense that my gods smile on us and our agreement. This is an honourable thing!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_05">This is fair to my people. All that’s left is to drink until we roll beneath the benches!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_requesting_06">You bless our meeting with these terms. I will show wisdom and accept them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_attack_faction_01">A thousand apologies, but such help as we could offer would arrive too late and be of little use.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_attack_faction_03">We cannot. Our armies are but cunning shadows for our defence, not for rash attacks.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_attack_faction_02">We can do little against these people. Our wise men have read the flames, and see no good in them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_01">My lord’s protection will offer a shelter from the circling carrion birds.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_02">You are wise to seek shelter in our shadow. My master will guide and protect you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_03">An honourable choice. You have shelter from the storm for as long as you remain faithful servants.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_01">You have done nothing to earn the gold you so shamefully request!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_03">So it has come to this… never!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_02">You have no shame! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_third_party_attack_01">Will you not look to the future and attack these people? Divine Pharaoh sees danger in them!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_third_party_attack_02">Pharaoh, wise strategist and brave leader of all, requests that you attack these people when you are able.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_approach_requesting_10">I seek acceptance on certain matters that could result in common gain for our peoples. Shall we begin?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_third_party_attack_03">In His wisdom and in agreement with His generals, divine Pharaoh asks that you attack these people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_01">Ah, the gods blessed you with a fool's face and a sense of fun! Gold? Now that is for grown-ups…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_02">So, you think us dotards who will pay because we have no memory of services rendered? Fool!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_03">Thieves do not get the keys to the treasury. They get the gelding knife.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_single_payment_01">The gods show their displeasure at our association. They can be calmed with gold, I think.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_single_payment_02">Magnificence and greatness always come at a price. And our price must, of necessity, be high…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_single_payment_03">I am told our treasuries lack a sum of gold. Perhaps you might feel the urge to remedy that lack?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_01">A fitting gift and one that any Greek would be honoured to accept.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_02">This is a most worthy offering. On behalf of my people I give you thanks.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_03">We thank you. Your generosity will be long remembered by my people and the gods.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_wealth_high">Strong</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_respectful_10">Be assured that I hold you in the highest regard, but cannot accept your terms.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_03">Do not imagine you can climb into a Roman bed in search of warmth! Dogs stay in kennels!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_02">Lacking a blind, insane or diseased Roman to agree with your proposal, you will have to look elsewhere!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_01">Perhaps I should form an alliance with slaves in my vineyards? Or with passing lepers? Bah!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_06">I can almost hear the laughter of the Gods. You have stupidity that would pass for courage to ask such a thing!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_05">You seek a good marriage with Rome, and yet you have only the charm of an uncommonly ugly fishwife!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_04">Why should a Roman shackle himself to a corpse, and imagine safety in the act?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_attack_faction_01">Attack these folk? We bear the burdens while you reap the profits, I think! I refuse this stupidity!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_attack_faction_03">I will trample your gizzards into the dust before I ask my lord to risk a single warrior!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_attack_faction_02">Your notion is as wrong-headed as it is cur-like in delivery! Our armies do not bleed for you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_respectful_04">We must regretfully decline.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_respectful_05">With all respect, we cannot accept these terms.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_respectful_06">Although this offer is fair I must reject it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_respectful_07">You have shown great skill this day, but I cannot accept these terms.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_military_access_03">Rome's legions require passage through your lands, for purposes both noble and honest. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_respectful_01">The people of Carthage must reject your offer. Please accept my apologies.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_military_access_02">The Senate requests that their generals be allowed to march their troops across your lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_respectful_02">These terms would not be pleasing to my people, I must say no.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_military_access_01">The Senate require me to ask, politely, if Roman troops may enter your lands in pursuit of Rome's legitimate strategies.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_respectful_03">Your words may be honey to some, but the taste is too rich for a Carthaginian palate…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_respectful_08">Know that it pains me to say this: I reject your terms.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_reject_respectful_09">Your bearing has been just and honourable, but I must reject your offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_regular_payment_03">Your desire to sample Egypt's wealth is flattering but, perhaps, a touch ambitious in its implications…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_regular_payment_02">A fine jest, but not one that make gracious Pharaoh smile or open his ample purse.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_regular_payment_01">The Pharaoh, blessed by He, does not pay bandits when they come calling. Nor will He pay you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_vassal_status_01">The raging fire does not respect empty wind. Carthage will not bow to you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_vassal_status_02">Have you no sense? We will never kneel before the likes of you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_vassal_status_03">On what imagined authority do you come here and threaten the people of Carthage?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomacy_treachery_warning_declare_war_after_peace">Declaring war shortly after signing a peace treaty is considered an act of treachery and is condemned by all factions!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_03">It takes more than your stolen gold to win our favour. Give it to your remarkably foul gods!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_02">Keep your money. You will need it to pay your way to the afterlife. And it is tainted anyway…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_01">So, you think we will sell ourselves, like your women? You are truly mad, then, or stupid! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_regular_payment_01">I think not. Our gold would outshine your other treasures' worth a thousand fold, and you would feel shame.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_regular_payment_02">I am sure your needs are urgent, but my lord cannot give away gold he holds in trust.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_regular_payment_03">We do not give subsidies to passing acquaintances. Perhaps that is why our treasury bulges!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_03">Your words are worthy, but they have not won the day. Pharaoh, the master of the sands, will not agree.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_02">You ask much of Pharaoh, Lord of All, in seeking a treaty. He is not generous today. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_01">My Pharaoh, the favoured of the Gods, does not need mortal allies at this time.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_06">Such an agreement may well benefit you but Pharaoh, the father of Egypt, sees no benefit to his children.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_05">Fire and sword may come, but for now Pharaoh, shield of His people, sees no need for such agreement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_04">Your request of Pharaoh, the blessing of the heaven to His people, is unreasonable at this time. You cannot have such an arrangement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_attack_faction_01">I will hold your still beating heart before your eyes! Then, perhaps, you will learn not to give orders!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_attack_faction_02">The warriors of Carthage are lions not dogs! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_attack_faction_03">How dare you demand that Carthage throws her sons into your futile war?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_hand_over_region_03">These lands are surely mismanaged without Roman order. Do you not have the wisdom hand them over?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_hand_over_region_02">The Senators are confident that you will see sense, and hand these lands over for proper and Roman government.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_demand_hand_over_region_01">There is little to be argued in this matter as I am sure you see: these lands are Roman, and should be under our control.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_military_access_01">Rome does not open gates to passing ruffians.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_military_access_03">I fear we will now disappoint you. The Senate would dislike your men kicking up the dust in our lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_military_access_02">And why would Rome agree to anything so absurd? We are not yet touched by senility and madness!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_vassal_status_01">I cannot agree, my friend. Chance may have been unkind, but the gods have yet to finish their game!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_vassal_status_03">I had not noticed that the gods had cursed us, and ordered that we were to be your chattel goods.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_vassal_status_02">This is not a sensible proposition. Perhaps you have a stolen camel you want me to buy instead? </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_hand_over_region_02">The Senate bids me ask that you hand over these lands. It is a reasonable request.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_hand_over_region_03">There are few hands safer than those of a Roman and these lands cry out for a Roman's touch.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_hand_over_region_01">I am the agent of the Senate in this simple matter: will you hand over these lands, or not?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_05">No temple can stand upon just two pillars. We cannot agree.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_04">No. Last night, the earth shook as the gods moved. It was a warning of terrible danger…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_06">Dark clouds move across the sun when you speak, my friend. I cannot accept your proposal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_01">We will not agree. A trireme must have but one steersman. We must sail, for now, in different ships.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_03">Yesterday, I saw many dead fish in the water. Two kinds of fish. An omen, I feel…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_02">We see some gain for your people, but little for ours, in such an arrangement. So we must refuse you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_single_payment_03">Gold makes an excellent gift, don't you agree?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_single_payment_02">The treasures of Carthage are without number; we would share them!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_single_payment_01">The people of Carthage would like to offer you a gift of gold.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_defend_against_faction_03">These people are hungry jackals. Will you spare even one of your glorious armies to fend them off?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_defend_against_faction_02">We humbly request aid from your glorious armies against this surprisingly determined foe... </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_defend_against_faction_01">Can you help our defence against these people? I would offer sacrifice in your name if you can!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_requesting_06">We have much to discuss, shall we begin?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_requesting_07">Greetings friend. I have matters I wish to discuss with you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_requesting_04">I come to you with truth in my heart and a proposal on my lips.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_requesting_05">I am here to present terms, will you hear them?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_requesting_02">Carthage has matters to discuss with you. Will you listen?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_requesting_03">Greetings from mighty Carthage. I have a proposal I wish to discuss.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_attack_faction_offer_01">Dogs who bare their teeth must often be whipped to their kennels. Do you want our armies to attack?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_attack_faction_offer_02">The signs and portents suggest Ares stands with us against these people. When do you want us to attack?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_requesting_01">The people of Carthage extend the hand of friendship to you and yours.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_attack_faction_offer_03">Words have their place, but now is the time for an attack! When shall we move against these people?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_requesting_08">The people of Carthage have sent me forth to share words with you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_requesting_09">May the blessings of Ba'al Hammon be upon our discussions this day.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_demanding_10">I will not waste breath on pleasantries with the likes of you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_01">Peace? I would sooner make peace with the contents of a Persian peasant's putrid piss pot!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_02">You want peace? Very well! Wait but a moment, and a slave will bring you a draught of hemlock!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_03">The drowning man grasps for any passing wreckage! You can have a boat hook instead! In the face!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_04">"So, you ask for mercy, then. But you have roused Ares within us, and all the ""mercy"" of Hecate!"</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_03">Your merchants are cheats, swindlers, coiners, raggamuffins, robbers, thieves, slavers, crooks, fornicators, goat molestors… have I missed anything?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_05">We did not seek war or bloodshed, but when the blood being spilled belongs to you... I welcome it!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_02">There will be no trade with such as you. Our people like honesty, and full measure when they purchase goods!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_06">Peace? Peace? You prance in here like some gold-draped floozy to ask for peace? Are you insane?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_01">Your deceitful merchants can stay out of our lands and markets. We do not even want their money!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_01">Carthaginians are practical people and so, we accept the situation.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_03">We accept the protection that you have so kindly offered.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_02">You are quite right, Carthage is in need of your protection.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_01">The only golden thing you may have from us on a regular basis is the fillings of my chamberpot!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_02">Find your own money for catamites, whores and trinkets!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_03">Where then, is your begging bowl? Are you crippled? You should play the part to the full, or get nothing…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_third_party_attack_01">I beg you: take up the sword of Ares, and attack these people. They menace us all!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_third_party_attack_03">It is a terrible thing to spread war across the world but, I beg you, attack these wretches!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_third_party_attack_02">Your wisdom is renowned, and surely Athena herself would see that an attack on these people is necessary.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_requesting_10">I am a representative of the people of Carthage, my words are their words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_single_payment_02">Pharaoh, master of many slaves, offers you wealth, for such is His divine whim today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_single_payment_03">I am sure that you accept this treasure, drawn from the coffers of Pharaoh, the incomparably wealthy.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_single_payment_01">Pharaoh, long life unto Him, offers you the following treasure, for such earthly riches are unworthy of His concern.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_03">I fear I betray my people by agreeing, but I have no army of words to oppose it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_demanding_05">We have much to discuss, so let us begin.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_02">For my people, I accept. If there is fault in this choice, let the gods find it in me.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_demanding_04">Hear me and fear the might of Carthage in my voice!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_01">Gods above! Witness that my honour is unstained, even as I accept this offer as I must for my people!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_demanding_07">I will be brief. We have matters to discuss.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_demanding_06">The people of Carthage send word: you would do well to listen.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_demanding_01">Listen. I have much to discuss with you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_06">The gods will frown that I have accepted such paltry terms. But I do so knowing that it is necessary.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_05">I dislike much of our speech, but I put aside my concerns and agree to what must be agreed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_demanding_03">You will listen with rapt attention to my words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_demanding_04">For the good of my people I say yes, but I would have had more from our talk!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_demanding_02">Mighty Carthage would have you hear my words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_attack_faction_02">My lord Pharaoh, all wise in matters of war and peace, would be most displeased if I agreed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_attack_faction_03">"I say ""no"" to your request, being sure that Pharaoh, the heir of Osiris, will not attack."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_attack_faction_01">This attack is not wise, and I cannot recommend such a course of action to my master, Pharaoh, the shield of Egypt.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_demanding_09">Listen very carefully. I shall say this only once.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_demanding_08">Greetings. Now, to the matter at hand…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_single_payment_03">Our ancestors would be shamed if even one of your coins was accepted. They were proud, our ancestors…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_06">You worm! You dog! You coward! There can be no peace while your stink is in Pharaoh's divine nostrils!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_01">Your worthless goods do not interest the servants of Pharoah, from whom all wealth flows. Sell them to fools elsewhere!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_single_payment_02">A tidy sum, to be sure, but our hearts are full of courage, not lust for gold.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_single_payment_01">You have the heart of a merchant, my friend. A merchant. We do not want your gold.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_04">You desire peace? You will be disappointed in your remaining time for Pharaoh, all honour to His armies, desires war!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_03">Egyptian merchants would find it difficult to sell your foreign stuff in their markets. It is… tainted.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_05">Pharaoh, the sword of Egypt, will not be satisfied until he bathed in your blood, and violated your women folk!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_02">Pharaoh, whose words guide my every thought, would laugh to think Egyptians might want your shoddy goods.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_02">Peace? Peace? Is that a woman's weeping that I hear, or a coward's bleating for mercy? Mighty Pharaoh, executioner of the Gods, will give you nothing!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_03">There are many places in the desert, impudent wretch, where you would be found only by scorpions and jackals!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_01">The Pharaoh, Lord of the Two Egypts, will know peace once more, but only when you have all been shat from a sacred crocodile!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_attack_faction_01">My master judges the time is right for an attack on these wretches. Are you ready to carry it out?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_attack_faction_03">Will you sit, like old men in the shade, until enemies grasp at your throat? Or will you be warriors?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_attack_faction_02">Will you stand idle? Do these insolent dogs stir nothing in your bellies? Are you turned into women?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_offer_demand_09">Foreigner though you are, you can at least understand that divine Pharaoh favours you with this offer!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_offer_demand_08">Pharaoh, strength and health be His, bids me speak to you, foreigner. You, he bids listen carefully…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_offer_demand_05">I give voice to the desires of mighty Pharaoh! His merest whim should be your pressing concern.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_offer_demand_04">When I speak you hear the words of Pharaoh, mightiest of monarch and chosen of heaven! Listen well!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_offer_demand_07">Do not grovel before me, for I am only the servant of mighty Pharaoh. Instead, listen to His just demands!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_offer_demand_06">Heed me now, for I speak with the terrible and awesome voice of Pharaoh, son of Osiris. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_offer_demand_01">My Lord Pharaoh, whose words are meat and drink to all, has bid me speak to you concerning this important matter.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_offer_demand_03">Heed now the words of mighty and divine Pharaoh, and understand that you must respond well.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_offer_demand_02">I speak with the voice of divine Pharaoh, master of the Nile. You should listen as a supplicant.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_third_party_break_treaty_03">Zeus, father of us all, frowns upon discord. But surely false friendship is worse. Break this treaty, I beg you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_third_party_break_treaty_02">You are most worthy friends but your treaty with these folk is distressing. Can you not break it?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_client_state_on_table_tooltip_player_side">If the deal is accepted this faction will become your client state. Client states act as defensive allies, and pay tributes to their overlord each turn.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_third_party_break_treaty_01">Philosophy tells us that hypocrisy is a slippery slope to greater evil. For goodness sake, then, break the treaty!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_01">The gods have decreed that we must walk alone. The alliance is ended.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_03">Treaties have served us both well, but now the ancestors tell us to stand alone. We are done with you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_02">Blood and honour has bound us in friendship but now, in honesty, we must walk towards our own fates.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_05">The time has come for bonds to be broken. So speak our gods, and so must it be.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_04">We have had friendship but now you must find you own feast. Our treaties and agreements are done.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_cooperation_06">You have been worthy allies, but our unquiet ancestors tell us to put aside friendship. This we will do.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_02">My people are not your shield. Are you so sunk in cowardice? You are geldings indeed, then!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_03">You have the courage to ask this, yet cannot pick a sword to defend yourselves properly? Great gods!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_01">So… We fight your enemies while you hide, grow fat, and whore yourselves stupid. An excellent plan! Bah!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_01">Such a tribute will be welcomed by my most honourable master. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_03">You show generosity. On behalf of my honourable lord, I give you due thanks.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_02">This is a noble gesture and fitting tribute to the magnificence of my people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_relationship_neutral">Neutral</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_get_military_off_my_land_01">The gods show their disapproval in small ways but, it is clear. Please remove your troops from our lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_offer_demand_10">It is not divine Pharaoh's place to negotiate terms. It is your place to agree to whatever bounty He offers!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_get_military_off_my_land_03">We ask, with all possible deference, for the smallest of things. Please, have your armies march out of our lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_get_military_off_my_land_02">Our people grow uneasy, our livestock produce stillborn offspring and all goes awry. Will you please remove your armies?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_regular_payment_03">My embassy now is simple: divine Pharaoh's coffers ache for lack of riches. You have riches…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_regular_payment_02">Peace be upon Pharaoh, and may your wealth ensure His divine favour towards you…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_regular_payment_01">Pharaoh, wise and kind, will assuage His righteous disappointment at your conduct, but there is a price for this…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_trade_agreement">Trade Agreement</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_cooperation_02">I respectfully request that we co-operate fully in opposing our many enemies and rivals.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_cooperation_03">Rome always remembers, with honour, those she considers to be friends. Do you not wish to be counted in that number?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_cooperation_01">I am certain that, with your famed wisdom, you can see that Rome benefits from your friendship, and you from ours.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_cooperation_06">As long as Roman strength remains, we would be honoured to count you as friends and more.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_cooperation_04">Rome is not a friend for the new moon and an enemy in the old. Come, can we not help each other openly?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_beg_cooperation_05">Romans are a proud people, and would be proud to count you among the friends of Rome.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_client_status_02">What drunken, magical world was this proposal concocted in?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_client_status_03">You people have a strange sense of humour. I fear I don't understand this joke.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_client_status_01">No, a thousand times no!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_09">Welcome friend! Let us conclude our business with good haste, and then enjoy the pleasures of this house!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_08">Come, my friend, speak! We are men of words, and so serve our peoples with honour.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_07">I will be a patient audience for your speech, sure that you come to deliver a profitable message.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_06">Greetings, friend. Let us use our time together in wisdom, and seek accord.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_05">I greet you in my master's feared name. Speak in honesty, and you will be answered likewise.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_04">I greet you as befits your reputation. Now, friend, speak plainly so that we may fall to haggling!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_03">I will do you the honour of listening to your terms, hoping to hear wisdom and profit in them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_02">Speak, my friend! Unburden yourself of diplomacy and let us find agreement here, in the fashion of simple, honest men.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_01">Welcome, friend, welcome! Come, sit! Enjoy the pleasures of my home, and let us find accord!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_single_payment_03">Ah, my friend, you ask too much. Gold is happiest with gold it knows, not in a stranger's vaults.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_single_payment_02">We would find beggars at the gates every day if we gave you money. I fear we must refuse.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_attack_faction_01">Your scheme of attack has merits but, what with the religious festivities, I don't think our armies can do it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_single_payment_01">Scant respect would be yours if friendship is purchased! We hold you in much higher regard!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_attack_faction_02">I am told that our armies are still being trained and cannot attack. Our generals are very thorough.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_attack_faction_03">The omens for such an attack are fearful and terrible indeed. We are not fools…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_offer_demand_08">This offer is fair, don't you agree?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_offer_demand_09">When I speak, you will listen. Or suffer the curse of Tanit…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_offer_demand_04">You would do well to consider my words carefully.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_offer_demand_05">Close your mouth and listen. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_offer_demand_06">Consider my offer quickly. Ba'al forgive me, I am not a patient man. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_offer_demand_07">I have little time and even less patience!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_offer_demand_01">The people of Carthage sent me to discuss this important matter.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_offer_demand_02">This proposal is just. Do not make me wait for your decision.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_offer_demand_03">I speak with the voice of mighty Carthage.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_begging_01">We Greeks are a realistic folk, and will accept this accord, even as it hurts our pride.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_begging_03">You speak with wisdom and grace. We accept and embrace your offer!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_begging_02">I must accept, although my honour cries out against it. Your words have much truth in them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_begging_05">My people will find much joy in this! I accept. I will sacrifice for your continued good health!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_begging_04">Your words bring satisfaction to the gods and to my people. You have wisdom indeed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_begging_06">With these words you bring joy to my heart, and hope to my soul. My thanks.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_receive_requesting_10">Welcome, honoured emissary. Speak, and I will answer with my master's voice.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_generic_offer_demand_10">I am here to discuss a matter of great import.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_single_payment_01">My lord expects that you will find it prudent to add a small, almost trifling, sum to his treasury…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_single_payment_03">A simple tribute is all that is expected and needed. Then all can be fair words between us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_single_payment_02">We demand only a modest weight of coin. My master always looks kindly on generosity…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_offer_or_demand_form_confederation">Form Confederation</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_single_payment_02">I guarantee that Pharaoh, the just and kind, will think highly of you if you contribute to his treasury.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_peace_06">We must have peace! This senseless war has gone on too long.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_trade_01">Carthage has much to offer the world.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_single_payment_03">There is no shame, and much virtue, in giving money to the living embodiment of the gods, divine Pharaoh. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_peace_05">Hostilities between us must end.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_trade_02">Carthaginians love trade! Do your people share this love?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_peace_04">Carthage offers you the chance to live. You would be wise to take it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_trade_03">Trade is the life blood of our people, their beating heart!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_single_payment_01">My master, Pharaoh, from who all kindness flows, is most concerned you are burdened by an over-full treasury.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_peace_03">We have shed enough blood. Let there be peace for a time.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_peace_02">Now is the time for peace. Surely even you can see this?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_peace_01">We no longer see profit in war, and we offer you peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_military_access_03">Will your noble people let us enter your lands? We seek nothing else from you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_cooperation_04">The Senate does not offer Rome's protection to any passing stranger, so think carefully on what you say next.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_military_access_02">Our warriors will trouble neither man nor beast in your lands… Your Women? I cannot promise that…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_cooperation_05">The Senators, in their wisdom, have decided that your people would make worthy allies. I suggest you grasp this opportunity for co-operation. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_military_access_01">I humbly ask that my people's warriors may come and go in your lands, so that they may fall upon our joint enemies!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_cooperation_06">Strength can be found in friendship, between men and between peoples. The Senate feels that we could be better friends. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_cooperation_01">I will be plain, in proper Roman fashion. We both have enemies, open and otherwise. Co-operation would be sensible.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_cooperation_02">Formal co-operation, brokered in good faith by honest men, would of mutual advantage.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_cooperation_03">Rome's hand, stretched forth in friendship, is unwisely ignored. Consider carefully your next words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_peace_01">Carthaginians have long memories. There can be no peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_peace_02">You will have your peace when your cities are dust and your people are dead and forgotten.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_peace_03">We Carthaginians know how to hold a grudge and we do not forget anything!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_peace_04">Peace is for women and the weak!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_trade_03">Your trade goods are of little use to the master merchants of Carthage.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_peace_05">No, there will be no peace between our peoples.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_trade_02">We, the people of Carthage, cannot trade with you at this time.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_peace_06">Carthage does not forgive easily and it never forgets wrongs done.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_trade_01">Trade with your people would be of little benefit to the people of Carthage.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_factor_negative">They condemn...</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_begging_01">In the name of the Lord of the Two Egypts, strength and health be His, I accept your most worthy proposal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_begging_02">Pharaoh-- strength be his!-- will bless you for suggesting such a thing! I accept in His mighty name.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_begging_03">O Pharaoh, Lord of the Two Egypts, forgive your humble servant for accepting this proposal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_begging_04">Your sagacity is matched only by your persuasive wit. I accept for glorious Pharaoh, all health be His!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_begging_05">I must accept, in glorious Pharaoh's name, for we can do nothing else when troubles surround us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_begging_06">I will give voice to masterful Pharaoh's acceptance, and His gratitude for your dealings with His humble servant.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_offer_or_demand_military_alliance">Military Alliance</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_single_payment_01">Egypt's mighty Pharaoh, the heir of Osiris and Horus, brother to Isis, annointed of Ra, is not minded to open his treasury.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_attack_faction_01">This enemy must be attacked! Are you waiting on strategic advice from your gods?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_single_payment_02">Egypt's treasury doors will remain resolutely shut. Do not look for gold here.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_attack_faction_02">There is glory to be had! Attack! Do not sit back and watch from the safety of a hilltop.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_single_payment_03">"I will not trouble Pharaoh, from whom riches flow, with such a request. I say ""No"" for Him."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_attack_faction_03">Have your guts emptied at the thought of an attack? Why do you not attack? They deserve your swords!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_factor_past_war">Past war with</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_join_confederation_03">Are you fools? Will you hold back when you can be a part of what is decreed by the gods?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_join_confederation_02">We are bonded by blood, honour and war. It is the will of the gods that you unite with us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_join_confederation_01">Join with us. It is right and proper, and the spirits of our ancestors long gone will be pleased.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_offer_demand_10">We fire this arrow straight and true. It is up to you to snatch it from the air.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_hand_over_region_03">Rome holds those lands fondly to her bosom. The suggestion that they be handed has scant merit.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_hand_over_region_02">I can safely speak for all Rome in this matter, and say that such a change of ownership is a not going to happen just yet.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_hand_over_region_01">"I am reasonably confident that the Senate and People of Rome would have me say ""no"" to this ridiculous suggestion."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_regular_payment_01">We cannot... umm... square that particular hypotenuse for you. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_regular_payment_03">We had not grasped that you grasped at our wealth. I thought our friendship deeper…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_regular_payment_02">You come to us in search of gold? We are rich in wisdom, but the state of our treasury... Pffff!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_trade_01">Your wares are as common as salted fish. We no longer see merit in trade with your merchants.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_trade_02">Your potions and charms had novelty, but it has faded. Therefore, keep your merchants out of our lands. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_trade_03">You no longer have goods fit to sell in our markets. Trade is done. Look to others for money.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_02">In the name of Pharaoh, the firstborn of all Egyptians, I accept your generous tribute!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_03">I thank you for your gift, in the name of Pharaoh, divine light of His people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_offer_demand_08">I speak with a simple tongue, without trickery. Accept or do not accept, but do so honestly.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_01">You are wise indeed to give gracious and beneficent Pharaoh such a handsome gift!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_offer_demand_09">When I hunt, I look for sport. When I speak, I look for honest answers.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_offer_demand_02">I offer this in my lord's name, for he is master of all men, and a ruler without equal!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_offer_demand_03">I speak with honest and honourable tongue. I demand that you listen with equal honesty!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_offer_demand_01">It is time to speak with an eye to mutual profit. I offer this because you are an intelligent man.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_offer_demand_06">If you truly serve your gods, you keep a clear mind and think carefully on what I say.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_offer_demand_07">Do not look for an answer to my words at the bottom of a wine cup, friend.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_offer_demand_04">My offer is shaped intricately and with great care. Do not dismiss my words lightly.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_offer_demand_05">Your next move is simple: you take this offer and we both prosper from it!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_regular_payment_02">Will you not realise your position? You should be giving us a tribute, you know…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_regular_payment_03">It is time, my friend, to share some of that wealth that currently sleeps in your treasury. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_regular_payment_01">Your people have much gold. Philosophically, this is very bad for them. Put some of the money into our coffers.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_reliability_medium">Unreliable</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_client_status_03">There is little merit in such an arrangement for my people. I can see the appeal of the idea to you…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_client_status_02">An offer so pregnant with sincerity is not lightly refused, but this one must be. My master cannot agree.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_client_status_01">You undoubtedly think your offer generous but it is only the direst insult, and I reject it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_regular_payment_02">The tangible good wishes of Rome are offered only to those considered worthy.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_regular_payment_03">Rome’s coffers bulge, and the Senate considers that your people are worthy to gain from the surplus.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_trade_agreement_tooltip">After signing a trade agreement a trade route will link your capitals. The more resources you own, the higher the chance this faction will sign the treaty. The predicted income of this trade agreement would be: %n</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_regular_payment_01">Rome's money reflects an accurate appreciation of your worth.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_single_payment_01">O! A fine jest! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_single_payment_03">The sun will set in the east before your hands grasp Carthaginian gold!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_single_payment_02">Sniff elsewhere for your gold, jackal!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_relationship_hostile">Hostile</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_05">This is not a time of peace. When the trees sleep, when the moon has waxed and waned, then, maybe…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_trade_02">I am sure that your wares will find a home somewhere, but not with us…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_04">I expected such an offer, but not so soon. My people still enjoy the taste of glory…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_trade_03">Your goods... well, no.  We see little gain in trade between our peoples.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_06">Our gods do not want peace. Our gods want blood! And honour! And sacrifice! We do what the gods ask…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_trade_01">I do not think our people want your trinkets. They like honest, manly stuff for the most part.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_01">Ah, you joke, even in this! I admire your people for their sense of humour!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_03">Silence has not yet fallen. It is not the season for peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_02">You are a funny little man. And we do listen to what funny little men want.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_player_must_become_vassal_01">"The wise woman has spoken: ""You have no chance to survive make your time."" Be wise! Accept your new masters!"</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_player_must_become_vassal_03">Your freedom means less than nothing when you die in fear. Give it up, and live, with new masters…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_player_must_become_vassal_02">My people are wise and worthy masters. Be wise, and take the expected oaths. You can still prosper.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_requesting_08">I am to speak of agreements with you, honourably offered and honourably received.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_requesting_09">My people are not word wastrels. We speak to the point but, I hope, with honesty.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_requesting_04">I hope I am welcome here, and that my words find willing ears and wise hearts.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_requesting_05">The greetings of the gods to you. I carry my people's word-hoard, a gift for you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_requesting_06">I ask only that you listen. I am the messenger for my people, and an honourable son of honoured ancestors.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_requesting_07">I bring you word from our elders and wise women, crafted in good faith, and delivered with truthful tongue.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_requesting_01">I come to give of my word-hoard. Will you listen as I speak for my people and my gods?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_requesting_02">In the name of our people, greetings! I have words. And if the gods will it they are words of friendship.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_approach_requesting_03">I greet you! May the Gods of Fellowship bless our meeting.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_hand_over_region_01">Pharaoh, the great and incomparable, is disappointed that he has even had to ask for these lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_hand_over_region_02">The request is not unreasonable. All in these lands will be happier with Pharaoh, just and kind, as their ruler.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_demand_hand_over_region_03">I will brook no arguments. Mighty Pharaoh should… will… be master of these lands. Immediately.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_single_payment_03">We humbly ask for a single, modest subsidy to help our people through a dark time…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_hand_over_region_02">Pharaoh, who is justice and mercy in mortal seeming, is willing to become lord of these lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_single_payment_02">We make this modest request in the knowledge that your coffers strain to contain your wealth…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_hand_over_region_03">I most humbly and respectfully request that these lands are turned over to Pharaoh's divine and merciful care.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_single_payment_01">What I ask is such a little thing, an inconsequential thing, that I almost hesitate to mention the amount…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_hand_over_region_01">Is it not cruel to deny the people of these lands the chance to live beneath that most benign and kindly of lords, great Pharaoh?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_04">Thank you, but the Senators have no need of defenders at the moment. They have all of Rome at their backs!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_05">The Senate has seen no merit in such a marriage between states. We will stand, properly virginal, without you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_06">Rome is strong enough alone. We must decline, then, but the Senate will note your offer with due respect.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_01">Romans thrive in foreign ventures only when such works are subject to sensible Roman direction.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_02">The Republic's defences do not need another ditch, and Romans do not hide behind others.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_03">Your scheme shows all the cunning of your people, but it does not meet with the Senate's approval. No, then.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_single_payment_01">The minds of Carthaginians cannot be changed by the glitter of gold.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_single_payment_03">We do not need your charity!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_single_payment_02">Gold, like everything else, melts before the flame…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_demand_peace_01">There is a time when warriors must sheathe the sword, and talk, for the good of their people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_demand_peace_03">The sword was drawn, but now it is blooded. End this feud. We offer peace today, or the sword tomorrow.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_wealth_low">Weak</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_demand_peace_02">Only the greatest dare speak of peace to their enemies. Only the weak seek the death of all.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_demand_peace_05">Shall we hack at each other, until our enemies can gorge themselves on warriors' flesh? Or will it be peace?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_demand_trade_02">Set aside thoughts of war for now. Trade is what concerns me today. Traders can bring prosperity to all!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_demand_peace_04">We come to you in strength, to speak words of strength. Reply, then, with the strength that welcomes peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_demand_trade_03">My offer is a straight-shot arrow. My people want your trade goods, trinkets and the like. What say you?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_demand_peace_06">Our struggle will end badly, and with little honour for anyone. My elders suggest peace. What say you?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_demand_trade_01">My lord's offer is simple: trade. You have much that we want. So, what say you?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_defend_against_faction_01">I fear that you are suffer the wrath of your gods. Only a fool aids even his friends against the gods…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_defend_against_faction_02">"Help? No. The generals say this will put your attackers ""off balance"". This is a good thing, apparently."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_defend_against_faction_03">Destiny deals many cruel blows when the gods turn away. This is just one more of those blows.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_hand_over_region_02">I will speak straight to the sarissa's point: these lands should be ours. Hand them over. Earn our gratitude.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_hand_over_region_03">We have claim to these lands, by ancient blood and by the decree of the Olympian Gods. Well?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_hand_over_region_01">According to the wise, the gods decreed long ago that these lands were to be ours. Do you defy prophecy?</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_beg_third_party_attack_03">I come to ask this: will you stand with Rome and show courage and honour? Will you attack?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_beg_third_party_attack_02">Glory could be yours! Take it in open battle against these people! Rome would stand with you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_01">Peace? Peace? Peace! Do you think Rome ruled by old women and dotards unable to lift the sword?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_03">You speak of peace when Roman blood cries out for vengeance and Roman swords are not yet blunted with killing? Never!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_02">Roman wits are not entirely fled, Roman courage not entirely spent, and you still rut in your hovels! Peace? Pah!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_05">Our legions will go on spilling your blood. It is of no use inside you, after all!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_02">You may love a good haggling like women over onions and goats and fish. The Senate has a state to run!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_03">We have no taste in Rome for your repulsive, ill-made trinkets and sullied goods.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_06">Your demands are weak and feeble-minded. Once roused, Roman hunger for blood is bottomless!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_counter_reject_02">You speak well for your people, my friend, but your words today have not convinced me. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_counter_accept_01">Your proposal has merit. Yes, yes… I see much benefit in agreement, and I pray my lord will too! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_counter_reject_01">Your ideas are undoubtedly golden within your heart and head, but in my ears they are dust.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_counter_accept_06">Your offer is fair, although I do wonder if you missed your calling. Friend, you should be selling second-hand camels!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_counter_reject_06">An acceptance would offend my gods, even as yours giggled about it!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_counter_accept_05">You speak a foreign tongue, and yet you bargain as well as, well, I do! This is most welcome!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_counter_reject_05">Your cunning would shame a Cappadocian grandmother, haggling over dates! And no, I do not agree.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_counter_accept_04">This is good. The gods will smile on our agreement, and all will be satisfied.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_counter_reject_04">I cannot settle on such terms. I would not serve my people to give in to such haggling.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_01">You do not need our gold. You have material riches enough, even as your souls wither and die within you!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_not_interested_in_further_discussion_06">You lay siege to my head with your words! I am done with talk! Bring me ale, and good pork!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_not_interested_in_further_discussion_01">Endless chit-chat is burdensome and womanly! Your words fill my ears and offer little of worth!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_vassal_status_01">My people will never be obedient to your rule. Go to the slave market if you need servants that badly!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_vassal_status_02">No, I do not think Zeus would approve of us being meek and accepting. And quite rightly.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_vassal_status_03">A well-stuffed purse at the slave market will get you Greek-speaking slaves. And with far less trouble.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_peace_05">Your plea for mercy is well spoken, but not pleasing to our ears. The war continues.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_trade_02">Our merchants do not want trade with you. And my master takes note of their undoubted expertise.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_peace_04">You dangle peace before us: a pretty trinket. But glory, that magnificent treasure, is within our grasp!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_peace_01">You may well talk of peace! I myself have asked for the moon and stars and a silent mother-in-law!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_defend_against_faction_offer_02">We could lend sword and spear to your cause. Say but one word, and we will come!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_04">You show much wisdom in seeking us as friends, but we must rely on our own strength.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_05">A treaty is not to my master's taste today. He is not in an understanding vein.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_06">The merits of a treaty seem to favour you above us. That I cannot accept.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_01">Your arguments have merit, but my lord would not wish me to enter into hasty alliances.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_third_party_attack_02">Carthage longs to stand at your side on the field of battle!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_attack_faction_02">The swords of Egypt's warriors are not yours to command. That is the right of Pharaoh, lord of war!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_attack_faction_03">So, you think of Egyptians as your mercenaries, to be expended in your futile attacks?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_attack_faction_01">Your heart brims with insolence to assume that Pharaoh, the sword of His people, makes war as you wish!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_demanding_10">I speak the majestic and just words of mighty Pharaoh, heir to a lineage older than all others!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_offer_or_demand_soft_military_access_indefinite">Indefinite Military Access</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_request_cooperation_01">The Senate considers it wise to seek co-operation between us, to the hopeful ruination of our mutual foes. And you?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_request_cooperation_03">The Senate and People of Rome see you as worthy allies and suggest that you consider an alliance.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_request_cooperation_02">An alliance would truly benefit us all and keep enemies suitably awed. Will you move to meet us on this?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_request_cooperation_05">Have you not noticed that a marriage, properly contracted and considered, can be harmonious even between unlikely partners?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_request_cooperation_04">Should we co-operate, our enemies would cower and seek safety. Do you not think that a fine prospect?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_request_cooperation_06">The Senate suggests that co-operation rather than hostility would serve us both well in the trying days ahead.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_peace_02">Peace, you say? Why should the welcome waters of peace flood your desert of war and suffering and despair?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_02">You expect all of Rome to be your catamites and whores? Slavery will never be a Roman's lot!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_peace_03">My master, mighty Pharaoh, a merciful lord to honest folk, is not yet done with fire and sword for you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_03">The sun does not rise and at set your whim, and likewise Romans do not heed your bleating!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_peace_01">The sword of war is in the hand of Pharaoh, the all-conquering. Why should He now sheathe it unblooded?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_01">The Roman who could obey one of you without vomiting through contempt has yet to be born!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_peace_06">Pharaoh, the dread lord of the living and dead, is not minded to grant you peace. He wants blood!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_trade_01">Trade is beneath the notice of Pharaoh, the all wise and all seeing, particularly trade with foreigners.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_peace_04">My lord Pharaoh, the wise and merciful to his servants, has not yet finished enjoying your misery!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_trade_03">Pharaoh, judge of all, is not inclined to allow your merchants into his lands. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_peace_05">Why would the Lord of the Two Egypts have any interest in peace with you?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_demand_trade_02">Egyptians do not need to be troubled by foreigners and their goods. So speaks Pharaoh, mightiest of the mighty.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_cancel_cooperation_03">The Senate order me tell you of endings in some matters, such as our alliance.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_cancel_cooperation_02">While we have appreciated your support, Rome must now look to its own defences, and to nothing else.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_cancel_cooperation_01">A straight and honest Roman road is not the path you walk. Our alliance is done.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_cancel_cooperation_06">The Senate wish an end to all arrangements with your people. There, it is said openly and honestly.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_cancel_cooperation_05">We must follow separate roads. Rome can be shackled to you no longer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_cancel_cooperation_04">Regretfully, Rome must discount your aid, and look only to Roman troops in matters of war and peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_reliability_high">Reliable</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_attack_faction_01">We cannot sacrifice our warriors to Ares simply because you lack the courage to do battle!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_attack_faction_02">So, you ask for slaughter… Hecate preserve us! Have you no stomach for a fight?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_attack_faction_03">So, your armies, being too feeble to march against your enemies, need proper men to do their work? No.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_demanding_08">Pharaoh, great hunter of the Nile, does you a great honour by sending me, His humble servant, as an emissary.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_cancel_trade_02">Your merchants will be missed, if only because thefts from honest traders in the market will be fewer!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_demanding_09">Kneel, and listen to the words of Pharaoh, among all the kings of men, the first and mightiest!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_cancel_trade_03">A lack of your goods? Woe! O! Hermes preserve us! Our womenfolk will be inconsolable! ...Probably.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_cancel_trade_01">I doubt our people will notice any lack of goods from your lands. Greek produce is rather excellent…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_demanding_04">I will speak with divine Pharaoh's voice, for His power encompasses all. You will listen with due diligence.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_demanding_05">Listen, for I speak for Pharaoh, master of sky and earth! I give voice to His majesty and truth!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_demanding_06">It is my part to speak according to divine Pharaoh's will. It is your part to listen respectfully.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_player_reliability_high">Dependable</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_demanding_07">Greetings from Pharaoh, master of all true men, to you, even though you are a foreigner and unworthy.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_demanding_01">On your knees as I speak the words of Pharaoh, glory and strength to Him, and give thanks for His wisdom!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_demanding_02">Tremble at the words of Pharaoh, mighty and terrible, as my  tongue gives voice for your unworthy ears!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_demanding_03">Greetings from my noble lord, Pharaoh of the Two Lands. I speak now with His voice, in honesty not flattery.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_01">Ba'al Hammon watches over the people of Carthage. Why should we need the likes of you?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_03">I have considered your offer and found that it is not to the benefit of the people of Carthage.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_02">We don't need friends like you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_05">Your offer may seem wise to you, but I see little profit in it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_04">Our strength is enough, we do not need your help.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_06">The people of Carthage will find little to their liking in your offer.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_single_payment_02">Roman favour is neither sold nor bought with your coin.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_single_payment_03">Such gifts often come with a heavy price. We must decline your kind offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_03">We bow down before Pharaoh, our just overseer. He will surely protect us from any cruelties.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_02">We will be your worthy servants, even as we serve Pharaoh, health and strength be His!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_01">Pharaoh, mighty steward of his people, is pleased that you will protect His people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_requesting_10">Pharaoh, who is like unto the Gods, orders me to give you greetings, and to speak plainly of his desires.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_approach_requesting_08">May Hermes give my words swift passage to your hearts and minds, so that we may have agreement!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_approach_requesting_09">Greetings, honoured friend. I would speak now of honour, glory and other matters…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_approach_requesting_02">I give thanks to Athena, for the wisdom that allowed this meeting to happen!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_approach_requesting_03">The blessings of Zeus on you and yours! I would speak a few words with you, of benefit to all.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_approach_requesting_01">I bring the greetings and good wishes of my people. Let us reason together, in friendship I hope.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_approach_requesting_06">I greet you in the name of my people. Let us talk simply and with honesty.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_approach_requesting_07">The blessings of the gods be yours and ours today. I ask only for willing ears to hear my speech.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_approach_requesting_05">I come as an honest emissary, to speak for my people as my ability allows, if you will listen.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_04">May jackals feast upon your coward's heart! </string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_angry_09">Did the fey folk take my wits? Do I suck at the teat of madness? No? Are you sure?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_angry_02">No, no, by the gods, no! One day your empty skull will find better use as a drinking cup!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_angry_03">Did your mother whelp any sensible brats? Still your flapping tongue, or my knife will find good use!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_angry_01">Bah! In another place my sword would take your head or manhood for such words!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_angry_06">So, you pour fine, civilized wine for yourselves, and a cup of piss for us. No, you fart-spawn.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_angry_07">"I say ""No"", but you speak well. I hope you soon speak with your mewling ancestors."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_angry_04">One more proposal like that and I will have you thrown, bound hand and foot, to starving pigs.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_angry_05">The gods give me strength! No! O! How I long to strangle you with your own stinking guts!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_02">The people of Carthage will wonder at this magnificent gift, we thank you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_03">A precious gift from honoured friends! On behalf of the people of Carthage, I thank you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_respectful_10">Your serve your people well, but you cannot alter my opinion in this matter. I must refuse.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_requesting_04">Greetings, and the blessings of the river from cataract to delta! I come to serve at divine Pharaoh's order.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_requesting_05">Pharaoh, whose words bring joy to every ear, bids me give His greetings, and speak to you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_requesting_06">Greetings, foreigner, in the name of glorious Pharaoh, the justice and master of Egypt.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_requesting_07">My lord Pharaoh, divinity in human flesh, wishes me to speak on his behalf concerning matters between our peoples.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_requesting_01">Greetings and such felicitations as do honour to my master, Pharaoh, health and strength be ever His!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_requesting_02">I approach in the dread name of Pharaoh, strength be unto Him. My words are His words, and should have a hearing.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_requesting_03">Greetings from my divine lord, Pharaoh of the Two Egypts. I speak as His voice, and listen as His ears.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_requesting_08">For Pharaoh, first among kings, greetings and blessings. We have much to discuss.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_requesting_09">The divine Pharaoh, in his majesty and holiness, sends blessings for our meeting, in the hope of a favourable outcome.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_hand_over_region_01">You do not need these lands. Our people need these lands. Be reasonable, friend, and give them to us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_hand_over_region_02">The gods gave use these lands. Hand them over, so that they can be properly ruled.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_hand_over_region_03">These lands will be ours. Hand them over, or our people's resentment may be too strong to control.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_approach_requesting_10">Hermes give us speed! Athena give us wisdom! And then let us give our people cause for satisfaction!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_01">We have every right to be proud, even as we accept new masters. Use my people well…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_03">Philosophy is of scant comfort in times like these, even as we accept the new order of reality.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_02">There is little joy in accepting how the world has changed. Very well, we will be servants of new masters.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_angry_10">Your gods gave you bravery. I will give your manhood to my dogs after any more such witty offerings!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_third_party_join_war_tooltip">Offer or demand to join a war against a third party. Offering to join a war against a hated third party may make a deal more attractive.  However, the more they like the third party, the lower the chance they'll make a deal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_respectful_08">Simple prudence means that I must refuse your offer, although I did enjoy your advocacy.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_respectful_09">In honour, I cannot accept your terms. They are well-intentioned, but fall far short of what my people need.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_client_state_on_table_tooltip_ai_side">If the deal is accepted you will become the client state of this faction. It's only worth considering such an offer if in desperately in need of allies.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_respectful_01">While your rhetoric is sound, the substance of your offer is sadly lacking. We cannot agree.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_respectful_02">I am sorry. I gain only the scorn of the gods and my people if I agree to your proposal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_respectful_03">You speak well, and with conviction. Unfortunately, what you say is like a trireme without a ram: largely pointless. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_respectful_04">"Athena has blessed you with the wisdom to speak well. She has blessed me with the wisdom to say ""No."""</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_respectful_05">I have listened, and considered. I will forebear from giving voice to more than a respectful refusal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_respectful_06">No. Your terms are reasonable as they leave your mouth, but less convincing when they reach my ears.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_generic_reject_respectful_07">I am impressed that you have spoken so well on your people's behalf. Now, I speak for my people: no.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_hand_over_region_01">The people of Carthage love their own, and your people will be well cared for.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_hand_over_region_03">I can assure you that the people of Carthage are fair and just rulers.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_hand_over_region_02">We find that we need more space. It would be wise to accommodate us…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_single_payment_01">A gift of Rome is not lightly given, and never to common folk.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_single_payment_02">The Senate's favour and friendship is rarely expressed in such golden terms.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_single_payment_03">Rome finds you worthy of benefitting from our prosperity.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_single_payment_01">Our warriors thirst for your blood and hunger for your women. Perhaps they can be distracted by gold…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_single_payment_03">While the spirits of our ancestors have no use for gold, they do know that their living children think differently…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_single_payment_02">The love of gold can stir evil in men. Give us your gold. Avoid the evil it brings…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_player_must_become_client_02">Your path leads to suffering for your people. Our rule will spare them that future.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_player_must_become_client_03">We will be strong and just masters, ruling as wisdom and the gods dictate. Accept the situation.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_demand_player_must_become_client_01">Accept the will of the gods. We are your masters now, and your people will have their due rewards.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_attack_faction_offer_02">Our warriors, both proven and young, have a taste for battle. Give us word, and we will attack these people!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_demanding_02">You don't have a little Greek blood, do you, by any chance? Your proposal here is ripe with intelligence!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_demanding_03">Gods of Olympus, hear me! I accept, but do not punish my tongue saying what my heart does not feel.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_demanding_01">I accept, and gladly. You have shown good sense here today, and might almost be a Greek in your thinking!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_demanding_06">This is not a sweet wine, but I drink it for the good of my people. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_demanding_04">I can agree to this, although I do think the wine too insipid to drink and seal the bargain…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_demanding_05">I must serve my people and accept these terms but, by Zeus, we should have more!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_requesting_01">The Gods of Olympus rejoice when men show such good sense! We have an accord here!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_requesting_03">Excellent, we accept and I give thanks to Athena for granting us all wisdom!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_requesting_02">I accept. We have an agreement, and I'm sure I have some decent Cyprian wine around here somewhere…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_requesting_05">Your proposal has merit for my people and, I am sure, the gods favour agreeable men.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_requesting_04">Now we can drink, and give thanks to Dionysus for the wine. We have agreement!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_accept_requesting_06">I can settle on these terms in the sure knowledge that I have served my people well.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_hand_over_region_01">I wish to make clear that this offer of lands in no way diminishes my master's power and majesty!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_hand_over_region_03">These people are not natural subjects to my master. Perhaps they will do better beneath your whips…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_03">Our forces will no longer enter your borders, but we cannot see this as a friendly banishment.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_hand_over_region_02">These lands would, I think, flourish under your stewardship. We say  claim them as your own!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_02">As you wish. I had thought our men caused little offence, but I seem to be wrong…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_offer_or_demand_peace">Peace Treaty</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_military_access_01">Can we march through your lands? We are honourable, which is why I am confident asking for this favour.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_military_access_03">Our armies, small in size, well trained, and entirely honourable in conduct, need safe passage through your lands…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_military_access_02">Respect for you among our soldiers is such that we must ask permission before they enter your borders.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_cancel_treaty_trade_agreement">They have ended their trade agreement with you</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_hand_over_region_02">We would never surrender people to the likes of you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_hand_over_region_03">To tear land from Carthage is akin to tearing the heart from my chest! No!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_hand_over_region_01">The people there would not take well to new masters. They have an independent nature…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_hand_over_region_01">Mighty Pharaoh, the light of heaven and earth, asks that you do not deny the people of these lands the chance to live as his subjects.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_hand_over_region_02">Pharaoh, the speaker of truth, seeks only the best for these people. Give over their lands to Him.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_10">I will listen further, my good and honest friend, in the hopes you have a proper offer to make.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_military_access_03">Can you not find it in your noble hearts to allow passage to divine Pharaoh's armies?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_military_access_02">Seeking the dignity of all, Pharaoh, captain of the hosts of Egypt, wishes armies to march through your lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_military_access_01">The armies of Pharaoh, the captain of Anhur, travel where they will, but politeness before entering another's domain is prudent.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_01">May jackals eat your liver! You insult the Pharaoh, strength to Him, by thinking of Him one as your common trollops!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_02">So you think Pharaoh, may his life be ever-long, some kind of common labourer then? You are much mistaken.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_03">Your humour will eventually be the death of you. Divine Pharaoh does not need your pensions!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_01">A fine gesture. My people welcome this gift and will hold you in high regard.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_03">By the spear! This is a worthy tribute. I gladly accept it for my people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_accept_state_gift_02">A noble act worthy of your ancestors. The gods and my people accept your offering.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_09">My friend, I had hoped for a belly-stuffing feast. Instead, I am given crumbs from your cheapest dishes…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_08">I always check the teeth of a camel before I buy it. This beast is definitely good only for soup.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_reliability_very_high">Loyal</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_01">Such a thing cannot be countenanced. Our people, not to mention our gods, would forever mutter and be displeased.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_03">I am not a sun-drunk fool, seeking water at any price.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_02">I cannot accept such an offer. My lord would rightly wonder whether a camel had kicked me in the head!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_05">We are not so bent with the weight of the world that we will bow to this offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_04">I can give voice to no acceptance. My lord would have my family sold for such insolence.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_07">This offer is a poor one. Even a beggar in the marketplace would haggle over such a small coin!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_06">My friend, I had not noticed my feathers, for surely you think me a carrion bird, to offer such scraps!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_player_must_become_client_03">Your people would surely offer thanks if you accept our terms. Rome is a noble and generous mistress.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_player_must_become_client_02">Surely you will now see wisdom in the Senate's offer: become the servants of Rome, and Roman glory will flow over you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_player_must_become_client_01">The time has come to be wise. Heed this, the Senate's generous offer, and accept Rome as your master in all things.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_03">We are done. Do not look for shade in our tent from the desert heat at noon.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_02">The bond between our peoples is broken. Do not look for us as friends in the marketplace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_01">Very well, our arrangement is over. The winds will blow us as they will, to whatever fate awaits…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_06">If this is your wish, so be it. I am puzzled as to how you profit by this ending.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_05">I fear you have chosen a path after too much wine, rather than with good sense…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_04">So be it. Look to your own gods for safety. We will look to our swords.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_hand_over_region_03">These people are loyal servants, and deserve our loyalty in return. You cannot have their lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_hand_over_region_02">Only the gods could snatch those lands from my master’s iron grip.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_hand_over_region_01">My master will not hand over one stone, let alone a province because you or anyone else asks politely.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_single_payment_02">I will be honest. I seek coin as token of your good and continued friendship.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_single_payment_03">My honourable master would have me talk of gold. A lump sum would ensure his good opinion.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_single_payment_01">There is much to be said for generosity between friends. It profits both parties, don't you agree?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_third_party_break_defensive_alliance">Break Defensive Alliance with...</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_peace_03">Much blood has been spilt. Rome suggests that we agree terms to staunch the flow on both sides.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_peace_02">An offer of peace from the Senate should not be spurned. Now, what say you?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_peace_01">Peace, honestly forged between men, is a worthy thing. What say you?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_peace_06">The Senate sees no profit in continuing hostility. Let us move towards peace.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_trade_01">Trade with Rome would surely bring benefits to your merchants, and our traders.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_peace_05">Our war has brought bloodshed, but without gain or progress. Let us end this senseless conflict for the good of all.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_trade_02">Roman merchants trade as they are told. What of yours? Would you have coin?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_peace_04">Many good men have died in our wars. The Senate looks for find terms that will bring rest to all our swords</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_offer_demand_trade_03">Trade prosperity and comforts for both our peoples. The Senate hopes you agree to such a future.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_client_status_03">I have given ear to your terms but the Senate will, quite rightly, be deaf to this idea.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_client_status_02">Your people are blessed by a sort of wit, but your humour is not to Roman tastes.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_client_status_01">Roman Senators do not bare their necks, even to the friendliest of foreign tyrants.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_01">You think to buy us? Be grateful you are not bent over an oarsman's bench, being used... Unpleasantly used.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_03">I do not think we want any of your gold. It looks stolen. Probably from a temple. Or a widow.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_02">You have an nasty streak of dishonesty in your soul, to judge all men by your own low standards.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_hand_over_region_03">There are a thousand reasons why these lands should be ours. Well?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_hand_over_region_02">Will you give over these lands to my master, so that proper profit can be earned from them?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_hand_over_region_01">My lord has ordered me to ask a simple question, with a simple answer: will you hand over these lands?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_01">The storm clouds do indeed gather. That is your problem. You offended the gods.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_02">Helping you offers little honour and less glory. You are, after all, a most wretched people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_03">Friendship with you seems more like having a leech sucking at my arse. We have no warriors.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_peace_treaty_tooltip">Peace can sometimes prove more profitable than war. If you are at peace with another faction you may be able to broker a trade agreement with them, or even gain an ally. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_third_party_attack_03">These people trouble even the gods! I beg you: march against them before it is too late!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_third_party_attack_02">The skill of your generals is famous! Can you send them against these people, who blight our lives?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_third_party_attack_01">My people are in danger! Can you not join with us and attack these dogs?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_02">Pharaoh, lord of many soldiers, sees no reason to commit even one warrior to your defence.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_03">Pharaoh, lord of the living and the dead, laughs at your pathetic attempts to buy safety with Egyptian lives!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_01">I speak in the voice of Pharaoh, my beloved master. The Nile will run dry before Egyptians obey your stupid commands!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_01">I hope Pharaoh, wisdom unto Him, sees merit in stopping His armies at your borders. I do not.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_02">No Egyptian army will enter your lands from this day on with peaceful intent.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_03">Pharaoh, honour and glory to His name, will not send his mighty armies into your rather paltry lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_third_party_break_client_state">Break Client State treaty with...</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_06">I cannot stomach your cowardice. Your people will have peace. When they are all stacked on the funeral pyres!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_01">Trade? Do you think us children, flattered and distracted by your pretty beads? Bah!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_single_payment_03">Pharaoh, in his divinity, forgives your impudence in offering money as though he were a common king…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_single_payment_02">Your offer is kind and respectful but Pharaoh, Horus reborn, has little need of mortal money.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_04">My ancestors were quite… inventive with dolts like you. They used fire, and skinning knives. Peace? I spit on you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_03">You think to turn our heads with your unholy trinkets? Save them for the little boys you favour…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_offer_single_payment_01">A foreigner will never understand that the blessing of Pharaoh, the Father of all, cannot be bought for tawdry gold.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_05">What? Peace? When your skulls are as yet unstacked, and your women have yet to kill themselves in despair?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_02">Your coins have your ugly-faced rulers on them. None of my people want them in their purses.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_02">Peace is not to our taste. The sword is different! And ale! And the screams of your women! Not peace!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_03">Peace? Be grateful I do not have your peaceful tongue ripped from your head for speaking such a word!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_01">Peace? Peace? I laugh at your peace! We do not make peace with fish-faced fools!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_trade_01">My lord has ordered that your merchants must leave, and our traders return from your lands. It will be done.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_trade_03">Our wise women have looked into the flame, and see no good coming from trade with you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_trade_02">My people no longer want your goods. They displease them, and our gods. Trade is done.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_attack_faction_02">If you strike the blow will be unexpected and all the stronger for it! Can you not march?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_attack_faction_03">Come! Profit from this war! Order your generals to march and attack!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_attack_faction_01">Are you willing to carry out an attack? My friend, it is such a little thing that my lord requests!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_wealth_very_low">Very weak</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_cooperation_03">It would be unwise to reject this generous offer…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_cooperation_02">Our protection is not offered lightly. Consider your words carefully.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_cooperation_01">We should come together to fight our mutual enemies.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_cooperation_06">I am here to offer friendship. You would do well to consider it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomacy_treachery_warning_break_treaty">Ending a treaty shortly after signing it is considered an act of treachery and is condemned by all factions!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_cooperation_05">We are valuable friends, very valuable.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_demand_cooperation_04">We offer you our hand in friendship: do not push it aside.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_single_payment_01">I had hoped you thought better of us. A bribe? Really? Are we so… mercenary in your eyes?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_single_payment_03">Your gold would be well spent by my people, but they would remember where it came from, and be ashamed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_single_payment_02">Gold is usually offered in payment of service. We are not your servants, friend, are we?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_attack_faction_01">You expect too much. Roman lives will not be thrown away on such a foolish adventure!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_cooperation_06">Together, we achieved much, but the parting of the ways has come, as it always must in mortal affairs.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_cooperation_05">The time has come to end our arrangements. A sad day, but unlike a divorce there are no mothers-in-law involved!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_attack_faction_03">Who are you to throw Romans into battle? Your plans are those of shallow, vain people soaked in stupidity!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_cooperation_04">Once we were proud to be your allies. But the years change much in men's hearts, do they not?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_attack_faction_02">Romans do not bite like dogs at your command! Never that! You march alone on this.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_cooperation_03">The gods have given signs that we must bring our friendship to an end. And I am a pious man…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_cooperation_02">Your support was welcome in times gone by but all things have a season, and a time to pass.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_cancel_cooperation_01">We have consulted the seers and they do not speak well of our diplomatic arrangements. They end here.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_too_many_counters_01">Enough! Enough! Your words are as endless and pointless as the barking of Sicilian dogs.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_too_many_counters_03">I fear that the day has run out, as has my backside's endurance. I must away and deal with other business.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_too_many_counters_02">Even I, an envoy well used to Roman bureaucracy, grows weary of endless chattering. And so, good day to you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_military_access_03">Our armies will march beneath a banner of peace in your lands. It is our rivals who should know fear!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_too_many_counters_05">I fear we test the patience of Saturn himself. We seem destined to part without agreement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_military_access_02">My master’s armies will soon be at your gates. They merely pass through, hunting other game…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_too_many_counters_04">This has been a tiresome chase and still we are no nearer to our quarry. I think we should end our talks. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_military_access_01">My friend, my lord wishes to use your lands as a highway, a road to his rightful destination, nothing more…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_too_many_counters_06">I am here to find terms that will be welcome in Rome but I grow weary of this indecisive chatter. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_hand_over_region_02">This is a pointless courtesy... We will have your lands!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_hand_over_region_03">The people of Carthage require your lands. Give them to us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_hand_over_region_01">After careful thought and discussion it has been decided that your lands should belong to Carthage.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_single_payment_02">A Roman does not open his purse to fill the bowl of a passing beggar.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_single_payment_03">The Senate have the keys to Rome’s coffers. They will stay firmly shut.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_single_payment_01">Roman coinage sits ill in foreign, barbarous purses. Or so I am told.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_defend_against_faction_01">The time for sweet words is long past! We require your aid in this matter.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_defend_against_faction_02">I find overdramatic words cloud the issue. Attack them, Now!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_defend_against_faction_03">Carthage calls you to war! How will you answer?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_requesting_03">In the Rome's name, greetings! I come, as an Senatorial servant, to seek answers to questions of mutual interest.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_begging_06">The gods will rejoice at the words we have spoken today. You honour us with these terms. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_requesting_02">In the name of the Rome, salutations! Let us speak as friends, and conclude any business in mutual satisfaction.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_begging_05">This agreement is like a feast after an empty belly! You are a truly worthy friend!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_requesting_01">Hail! The Senate and People of Rome send greetings and a proposal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_begging_04">Yes! Your words show wisdom beyond your years. I knew your people to be honourable! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_begging_03">I will take word of our agreement and put it before my people. They will  feast in celebration!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_requesting_07">From the Senate, greetings and respect. From the People of Rome, honest words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_begging_02">All praise to the gods! They have led us to wise speech and heart-felt friendship! I agree!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_requesting_06">Hail! Rome greets you, and I am sent to speak on her behalf in many matters.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_accept_begging_01">By all the gods, your word-hoard is golden truth! I agree with my heart and tongue to all you say!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_requesting_05">Greetings from the Senate and People. I bring words that may bring joy to your ears.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_requesting_04">I am sent by the Senate to request your attention in some small matters.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_requesting_09">Rome desires me to speak the Senate words to you, that we may come to a satisfactory end.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_requesting_08">I come to offer greetings, terms that may prove agreeable, and Rome's honourable pledges if necessary.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_accept_requesting_01">I accept. When two ride on the same camel they become better friends! Or, ha! They slit each others' throats!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_accept_requesting_02">On behalf of my people, I accept. The haggling is done, and we have an end to our talk!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_accept_requesting_03">We can ask no more. Your proposal is wise, honourable and, I hope, pregnant with future profit!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_accept_requesting_04">I will accept this in my lord’s name, for he trusts my judgement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_accept_requesting_05">We have good reason to accept such terms. My people will give thanks, I am sure.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_accept_requesting_06">You present honest terms that I accept and will present to my people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_offer_or_demand_break_defensive_alliance">Break Defensive Alliance with:</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_03">Your offer was kindly, but we have no need to share glory, ale or good pork with you. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_02">"I cannot say ""Yes"" and be anything but a mouth-friend. That sits ill with me, so I say ""No""."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_01">A man is judged by his friends. This is not the time for such an agreement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_06">The man who hangs upon the shield of another is nothing but a burden.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_05">Our ancestors were proud men, and stood alone against the world. For now, can we do any less?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_04">I thank you for the offer, but we are not wet nurses for weaklings.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_attack_faction_01">Our warriors are needed elsewhere, and even the sharpest sword cannot be thrust into two enemies at once.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_attack_faction_03">The wise have spoken. There is glory in it what you ask, but our path goes a different way. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_attack_faction_02">The spirits tell us that our warriors cannot be wasted on these dogs. You must tame them without us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_01">It sits ill with a Roman to accept such a state of affairs, but I do so on behalf of the Senate.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_02">The Senate accepts your guidance in all matters, and looks forward to future co-operation.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_accept_vassalage_client_03">Romans are a proud people, but also realistic and honest. We accept your command.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_demand_cooperation_02">Pharaoh, from whom all terrors flee, offers you the hand of friendship. It would be foolhardy to refuse Him.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_demand_cooperation_03">Pharaoh, the heir of Osiris, would have a treaty. A refusal would be tantamount to blasphemy!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_demand_cooperation_01">In His awful wisdom, the Pharaoh, strength and happiness unto Him, offers you his friendship and support.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_requesting_10">Jupiter's blessings upon our meeting, and let swift Mercury aid in reaching quick agreement!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_demand_cooperation_06">My lord Pharaoh, one of the beloved of Nut, is entirely confident that there will be friendship between us. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_demand_cooperation_04">My master, Pharaoh, the awesome and wise, offers you friendship and a shield against our mutual enemies.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_demand_cooperation_05">Pharaoh, lord of Upper and Lower Egypt, expects that you will accept His proffered friendship. Immediately.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_attack_faction_01">When do you attack these people? It is a simple warrior's question, and needs no great thought before an answer!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_attack_faction_03">How long can you stand aside and let these rats run free? When will you stamp on them?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_attack_faction_02">You stand idle while these cattle ticks burrow deep! Do you lack the courage for war?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_requesting_06">I, the humble servant of divine Pharaoh, the shield of Egypt, thank you for this agreement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_requesting_05">For the agreement: my humble thanks. Now, I must explain our dealings to the Lord of the Nile!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_requesting_04">Now that all is said, I will speak for Pharaoh, Horus reborn, and give thanks for this agreement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_requesting_03">I will speak for Pharaoh, the Lord of the Two Egypts, and give voice to his acceptance.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_requesting_02">Let all our words today be weighed against the Feather of Truth and let none be found wanting!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_accept_requesting_01">In the name of the Lord of the Great House, health and strength unto him, I agree.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_relationship_unfriendly">Unfriendly</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_military_access_01">I ask that you stop marching in our lands. The gods are offended by foreigners. You know how gods are!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_military_access_03">My master decrees that our borders are closed to your troops. I am but his voice in all things.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_cancel_military_access_02">Our lands are closed to your armies. We can no longer offer unhindered passage.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_cooperation_05">Think very carefully on this offer, and remember that a wise man knows the value of his strongest friends.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_cooperation_04">I say this: if we do not stand, back to back, with sword and shield, jackals will drag us down!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_cooperation_06">I will not demand agreement to a treaty, but I may think aloud about the consequences of refusal…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_cooperation_01">I offer this: an alliance against our enemies. Let us crush them into the dust, and see their blood soak the land!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_cooperation_03">My lord offers a treaty against our rivals. He does not make such offers in expectation of refusal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_demand_cooperation_02">I say this: together we have the might to make all enemies tremble. Consider this well.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_defend_against_faction_01">The armies of mighty Carthage march only in defence of their homes.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_defend_against_faction_02">Are you so weak that you are unable to defend your own borders?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_defend_against_faction_03">Carthaginians do not fight alongside the weak and the feeble.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_01">The Republic's coffers are wisely locked to prevent theft by insolent  brigands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_02">Roman physicians have leeches enough to bleed us without needing a nation of such creatures giving suck!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_03">Bandit! Thief! Whoremonger! You cannot dip your hand into Rome’s purse on a whim!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_offer_demand_10">Come now, the Gods themselves would listen carefully to an offer such as this from Rome.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_demanding_09">I am but the Senate's servant in this matter, and speak only as I must: greetings to you and yours.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_demanding_08">I will speak shortly as befits this meeting, and come to the business at hand. From Rome, greetings to you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_demanding_01">The Senate send such greetings as do them no dishonour, and words for your unworthy ears.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_03">The Senate would order me to experience the lictors' whips if I accepted your crude offer!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_02">You insult Rome twice over in one babbling utterance! We do not want your gold, or so little of it!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_demanding_03">In the name of the Senate and People, I speak of worthy things to the unworthy.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_01">Senators are not whores and costermongers to be bought for a handful of coin.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_demanding_02">The Senate and People of Rome have charged me to deliver their proposal. I am not envied in this task.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_demanding_05">I speak now with the dread voice of the Senate of Rome. Listen carefully, for my words have weight!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_demanding_04">Hail. Heed now to the words of the wise Senate, and the rightly proud People, of Rome.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_demanding_07">I come from Rome to do such honour as befits your station. So then, greetings.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_demanding_06">I bring word from Rome to your ears. You would do well to grasp my full meaning.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_military_access_01">I am sure you understand that it is in your interests to allow our troops into your territory.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_regular_payment_01">We are not merchants, but we understand gold. We understand that it turns aside many swords.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_regular_payment_02">Opulence is for the greedy, yet we still have use for gold. Indeed, we could use your gold…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_military_access_03">My master expects you to allow his armies uneventful passage through your lands. That is all.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_regular_payment_03">Is it the act of a brother to keep such wealth as yours entirely to yourselves?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_military_access_02">Our armies need a peaceful path through your lands. We expect you will allow this.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_third_party_break_treaty_02">Do not waste friendship on these ungrateful dogs, I beg you! These creatures will turn on you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_third_party_break_treaty_03">Do not remain tied to these wicked folk. Your people are better than that, as you must surely know!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_third_party_break_treaty_01">Why keep a treaty with these hateful wretches? They are a byword for evil and deceit!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_offer_demand_03">I speak as the representative of the august Roman Senate. You would do well to listen.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_offer_demand_02">I am commanded to speak in the name of Rome. Heed, then, most carefully, this proposal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_offer_demand_01">Your wisdom would be obvious to all the world if you heed my words, those of a plain-speaking Roman.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_offer_demand_07">Jupiter himself would not make you a better offer, my friend, so think carefully on Rome's words here today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_offer_demand_06">Come now, this offer is a good and honest one, and you should give it sensible consideration.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_offer_demand_05">You should be honoured that I make such an offer in the name of Rome and her noble people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_offer_demand_04">I speak for the Senate and all Rome. You should carefully consider this offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_offer_demand_09">Give careful attention, and then careful consideration in your wisdom to my words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_generic_offer_demand_08">There is much honour in accepting Rome's offer, for it is fair and just, like all Roman ideas.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_regular_payment_01">I had not realised that your people were reduced to begging for scraps at others' doors.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_regular_payment_02">Ah, friend, by the spirits this is sorrowful. I was about to ask you the same thing!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_regular_payment_03">Your war-chest may be empty, but you look to the wrong men if you hope to fill it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_vassal_status_01">I cannot think of a Roman who would endure such a forced marriage and not kill himself within a day!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_vassal_status_03">What? Shackle ourselves like common slaves? Are you are aware that you address a Roman?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_vassal_status_02">Why, in Jupiter's name, would the Senate wish to punish honest Romans? So, I say in their name: no!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_approach_demanding_10">I give you such greeting as does the Senate honour, for you seem to have little enough to spare.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_cancel_cooperation_06">Today is a day of honesty: all treaties between us are no more. Divine Pharaoh has ordered it so.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_cancel_cooperation_04">In honesty, I must tell you that Pharaoh, the wise and magnificent, has cancelled all treaties between us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_cancel_cooperation_05">All treaties between us are now void. Pharaoh, all honour is His, has so ordered the world arranged.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_cancel_cooperation_02">Pharaoh, Wisest of the Wise, knows men's hearts. That is why all former arrangements are at an end.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_cancel_cooperation_03">Pharaoh, blessed be His seed, has declared that Egypt requires no friends. Our arrangements are therefore ended.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_cancel_cooperation_01">The Lord of the Nile, Pharaoh, blessed be He, commands that our alliance be washed away, as mud in the fast-flowing river. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_factor_cultural_differences">Cultural aversion</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_get_military_off_my_land_01">The hills and valleys weep at your tread. The trees and streams are unquiet. Please: your soldiers must leave our lands. Now.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_get_military_off_my_land_02">My lord has talked to his wise woman. The crops may fail because your men dishonour our gods! They must leave!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_beg_get_military_off_my_land_03">My long-dead ancestors are uneasy. Your armies wake them. Can your warriors not go elsewhere?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_military_access_02">Carthage is on the move, and our journey takes us through your lands. Any objections?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_military_access_03">We, the people of Carthage, request permission to march our armies across your lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_military_access_01">The armies of mighty Carthage require access to your lands. Is this going to be a problem?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_hand_over_region_03">These people cry out for our just rule. Give these lands over to us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_hand_over_region_02">Prophecy tells of these lands in our hands. Do not stand by and idly defy prophecy!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_hand_over_region_01">My master has no doubts that you will see sense, and hand over these territories immediately.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_third_party_join_war_02">There is much glory to be found on the field of battle, by the Moon! Join us!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_third_party_join_war_03">War is the realm of men! Come, share it with us!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_beg_third_party_join_war_01">Join us! We must put an end to these creatures once and for all!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_client_status_01">"The Pharaoh, whose passed wind is a perfume to His subjects, cannot agree to such a ""marriage of inconvenience""!"</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_client_status_02">"The Pharaoh, whose titles by-the-by do not include ""Lord of All Fools"", would surely reject such insolence."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_demand_client_status_03">You expect what? You have missed your calling! The court of Pharaoh, the merciful, needs a comedian!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_01">Your virtue may be available in the market, but Roman honesty is prized above any coin.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_03">Romans find no pleasure in taking your gold except, perhaps, from your burning homes!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_02">Pah! Romans are not common mercenaries, to be bought with your bread, salt and coin!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_defend_against_faction_01">The plan is good, but we cannot send warriors to help in defence. Our wise women have spoken against it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_defend_against_faction_03">My people cannot move at every wolf howl. We wait to see what the pack is doing.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_defend_against_faction_02">I will not be a mouth-friend, to promise much and give little. We cannot help. You must stand without us. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_demand_peace_06">Peace is not an easy word. Warriors speak of honour and glory, but you have little of them left.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_demand_trade_01">We offer you trade, and our fine civilised products. You would be foolish not to take them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_demand_peace_05">Athena gives wisdom and Ares gives strength. I give you peace, if you will dare it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_demand_trade_02">Hermes loves a trader! Therefore, if you wished to be loved, you will trade with us…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_demand_peace_04">I offer peace, as I would throw a rope to a drowning man. Well? Do you wish clamber aboard?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_demand_trade_03">You stand to gain much from trade with us. Do not show the world you are fools by turning away.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_demand_peace_03">This senseless war can end today, but only if you see matters as they are, not as you wish.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_demand_peace_02">Your people are wounded by this war. Now is the chance to end the struggle. Take it, or suffer more.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_demand_peace_01">I make the offer of peace only from a position of strength. To offer peace otherwise is simple cowardice!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_demanding_05">Welcome, I suppose. NO! Do not sit. That is for Romans, and friends. You, for now, will stand.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_demanding_04">Speak your speech, so that I may go to the baths and wash away today's stench.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_demanding_07">Welcome, but expect scant pleasantries. Romans lack time to waste.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_demanding_06">Speak your terms. Give words plentiful haste. Other business calls this day.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_demanding_01">Speak, if you must, but know that Roman ears have little liking for foreign babble!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_demanding_03">Greetings in the name of the Republic, and so forth. Now, what do you want?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_demanding_02">Speak quickly, but do not expect the good wine to ease your parched throat when you are done!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_demanding_09">Do not waste time on pleasantries and babble. Speak what you must, and be done.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_demanding_08">Come then, speak. The Senate will consider what I hear, but you must speak without delay.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_cancel_client_state">Cancel Client State</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_client_status_02">"The gods have not yet made us mad, so the answer will be a polite ""No."" "</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_client_status_03">My people are not yet so far sunk in despair that they would agree to this proposal. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_demand_client_status_01">I have thought long, but I see little merit in this idea. It has no… logic… to it. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_cancel_trade_agreement">Cancel Trade</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_attack_faction_01">All men are born with free will, but not all should retain the right to use it...</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_attack_faction_02">These worms offend the people of Carthage and must be destroyed! Can we count on your support?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_attack_faction_03">The enemies of Carthage must be made to suffer!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_receive_demanding_10">You are welcome, but that welcome can become a farewell if you waste Roman time.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_peace_04">Apollo, in his wisdom, has decreed that the time of order is not yet upon us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_trade_03">You would not sell much in our marketplaces. Our people are rather sophisticated and clever, you know…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_peace_05">You took up the cup. It is a little late now to moan about the taste of hemlock!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_trade_02">I think trade a bad idea. We do not want simple folk to be scared of the marketplace…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_peace_06">My people will give you peace, one day. But not today. Today the war goes on.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_trade_01">My people are wealthy in intellect, and do not need your goods to add to their material wealth.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_peace_01">You want the war to end? Ares has drawn the sword, and is not yet ready to sleep.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_peace_02">A truce? Peace? When glory lies within our reach? No, I do not think so.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_offer_demand_peace_03">Sadly, the storm of war does not blow itself out because you men are getting a little wet…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_regular_payment_01">The hard-earned profits of Carthage are not lightly frittered away.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_regular_payment_03">It is a sad day when a man is reduced to begging, I pity you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_reject_demand_regular_payment_02">The people of Carthage guard their wealth with the ferocity of lions.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_third_party_join_war_03">Divine Pharaoh, heir to Osiris, is no stranger to war, but he requests that you too make it…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_third_party_join_war_02">Pharaoh, the merciful and peace-loving, requests that you join the entirely just and righteous war against these people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_third_party_join_war_01">With all respect, you have a duty to join the war against these people and so aid divine Pharaoh.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_respectful_08">Honesty is the highest form of respect, and so I give you an honest refusal in divine Pharaoh's name.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_respectful_09">Much wisdom has been spoken, but now I must speak my last for Egypt's part and, with respect, refuse you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_respectful_06">"You have spoken well, and deserve a respectful answer. I regret that Egypt must say ""No"" to this offer."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_respectful_07">I am sorry that our talks must come to this but, for divine Pharoah's part, I cannot agree. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_respectful_04">"As long as Nut, the sky goddess, shelters me, I will respectfully say ""No"" to your words."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_respectful_05">"I must speak in the voice of Pharaoh, all glory be His, and say ""No"" to your requests."</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_respectful_02">Would that I could accept your offer but, as a loyal Egyptian, I must reject it completely.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_01">Jupiter give me patience! The Senate will never agree to throwing away lives in such a futile way.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_respectful_03">I am sure that your offer was well meant but I, as humble servant of Pharaoh, wisdom be His, refuse.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_03">Rome will not use the legions in such a way. Only the Senate and the will of the Gods move Roman soldiers!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_respectful_01">Your words are as honey at first but leave a bitter aftertaste. I must say no to your offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_02">Rome will not spend a single coin or life to defend these pigs in their pigsty. Let them burn!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_third_party_break_nonaggression_pact">Break Non-Aggression Pact with...</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_regular_payment_02">We see you are overburdened with gold. We will take it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_defend_against_faction_02">We find ourselves facing mountain wolves, and would welcome an extra sword or two in our defence!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_regular_payment_03">Regular payment may secure our good will.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_defend_against_faction_03">You have a chance here to prove that there is no greater loyalty than to friends in need!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_demand_regular_payment_01">The coffers of Carthage are lacking in the stuff that passes for gold where you come from.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_defend_against_faction_01">Can you not see, my good friend, that defence against these beasts is a necessity? Will you help?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_generic_reject_respectful_10">Thoth has aided our deliberations, but alas! His aid was not enough, and I cannot agree.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_hand_over_region_01">I think not. Blood and treasure brought us those lands, and we value them. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_respectful_10">I have listened long to your witty speeches, but I cannot agree what lies behind that wit.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_hand_over_region_02">No, no, no. The spirits of those lands would be unhappy if we left. We have a duty to them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_hand_over_region_03">We hold what we have grasped. The sword and shield can only be taken from our cold, dead hands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_player_reliability_low">Untrustworthy</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_reliability_low">Devious</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_01">Rome's mighty legions will no longer march across your lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_03">Very well, we will withdraw. I hope your sleep will be untroubled by less friendly visitors!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_cancel_military_access_02">The Senate will be displeased that the legions are barred, but your decision is made.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_respectful_01">You serve your masters well, but you do not yet make a convincing argument for me. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_respectful_03">Your speak well, and you offer much, but I cannot give agreement here.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_respectful_02">Your offer is well meant, but it is not as good as I had hoped.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_respectful_05">The gods gave you a clever tongue, but you have not yet used it to say what I need to hear.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_respectful_04">Our haggling must, I think, continue a little longer. Your proposal lacks what I seek.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_respectful_07">Despite your eloquent advocacy, my good friend, we cannot agree to these terms.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_respectful_06">Your gods have not, I fear, given you the power of divine persuasion. I cannot agree.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_respectful_09">I am sure your words carry a cargo of honest intent, but they hold no value for my people. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_respectful_08">I cannot accept your offer. My head cautions me against your clever words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_beg_third_party_join_war_01">My friend, I will plead that you do only this: listen to the gods and join this war!</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_demand_military_access_03">After such insolence to Pharaoh's majesty, I should take your foul skin for a shield cover! Keep your armies away!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_demand_military_access_01">The lands of Pharaoh, Horus reborn, are closed now and in future to your foul, polluting tread!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_vassal_tooltip">Ask this faction to become your satrapy. If you are strong enough and they accept your offer, they'll gain your protection but lose most of their diplomatic freedom, effectively becoming your puppets.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_war_06">By the gods, we have war! Sound the horns! Sharpen the swords! You: pray to your foul gods…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_war_07">We will go to war then. Prepare your souls. You go to meet your ancestors!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_war_04">Our young warriors crave the chance to earn their rights as men! Your blood will wash away their youth!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_war_05">Good! Our warriors grew restless. Cutting your throats will be an end to boredom!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_war_02">Very well. The word-hoard will be locked away, and swords and shields burnished! We will have glory!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_war_03">Our warriors will march and our women will prepare the victory feast for their return!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_war_01">War it shall be! We are honest folk and prefer the sharp sword to the lying tongue!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_beg_get_military_off_my_land_02">While your warriors remain on Roman land our Senators are inconvenienced. Remove them and their digestion will surely improve!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_beg_get_military_off_my_land_03">While your people and their quaint customs delight many Romans, your armies do not. Please remove them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_war_08">War! Ah, a good word. Honest. Our men will take your heads... a pity you are not a handsome people!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_war_09">Have your women bid farewell to their men, for your heads will decorate our standards!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_beg_get_military_off_my_land_01">In the name of the Senate and People of Rome, I respectfully request that you remove your warriors from our lands, now.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_regular_payment_03">The wealth of Carthage is vast, and we are a generous people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_regular_payment_02">We would offer you regular payment that reflects your worth.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_regular_payment_01">The people of Carthage wish to honour you with gold.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_cancel_treaty_military_alliance">They have ended their military alliance with you</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_accept_03">We have talked long to reach agreement. Now we must drown ourselves in ale! Ha!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_reject_03">The gods forbid me to say yes, for we have talked too much and said little.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_accept_02">Excellent! We have agreement. Your mouth talks well. Let us see if your belly can hold ale!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_reject_02">Your speech holds much that is good for your people hidden in many words, but less for mine. I say no.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_accept_01">Our word-trade is now ended, and I will accept your proposal. Come! To the ale!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_reject_01">An end to over-long talk! Your offer is not what I want to hear! My throat yearns for ale, my ears for silence!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_accept_06">You speak well, but can you drink and feast as cleverly to seal our bargain? We shall see!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_reject_06">I find but scant meat stuck to your boney words. We have nothing more to talk about!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_accept_05">The spirits have guided us to common sense and agreement. Now, some ale to guide our wits to sleep!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_reject_05">I looked for agreement worthy of ale and song. And I have been saddened not to find it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_accept_04">Now, we have talked long, but we have agreement. I am content with the day.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_counter_reject_04">My belly grumbles for swine and ale. We must talk no more. The day is done.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_offer_demand_01">It is time to talk, like men, of many things. We can put aside swords for the time it takes to speak a word or two.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_offer_demand_03">I offer this in the name of our people. Let this be a sign of goodwill to come.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_offer_demand_02">I set aside my sword, to speak to you, warrior to warrior. This is the way of the world, for men.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_offer_demand_05">Consult your ancestors, but you will see the merit in the offer I bring from my people. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_offer_demand_04">Our offer is fair and honourable. By the gods, all will be as we agree here!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_offer_demand_07">I am not here to burden you with demands. My offer is what we consider worthy of your people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_offer_demand_06">I speak as the sword cuts: directly to the bone of the matter. Listen, and possibly give agreement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_offer_demand_09">It is the nature of warriors to cut to the heart of anything. Consider this proposal carefully.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_offer_demand_08">"We do not have ""the civilized graces"" but we offer our words honestly, from the heart. "</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_beg_third_party_break_treaty_01">The Senate wonder why you have a treaty with these creatures? Break it, and be free of obligation!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_beg_third_party_break_treaty_02">Rome does not understand why you hold to these people. Free yourselves of pointless obligations!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_beg_third_party_break_treaty_03">Why do you burden yourself with such unfortunate friendship? Cast aside these fools, and prosper!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_demand_military_access_01">Do you take me for a new Leontiades? I will not believe any of your wonderful assurances!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_demand_military_access_02">Open our gates to the armies of the untrustworthy? Do you think me old, feeble of mind, or just mad?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_demand_military_access_03">Allow this? I will not risk the honour of our women with your ruffians near at hand!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_acknowledge_war_10">The storm is coming. Your people will have never seen the like. Run for cover!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_regular_payment_01">Our people go hungry, and you have much. Would it not be the act of a brother to share with another fallen on hard times?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_regular_payment_03">My ancestors were practical men when they lived. For good reasons, then, I ask you for some gold.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_regular_payment_02">I make a simple request, and with respect: can you not spare some gold for my people?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_aggressiveness_medium">Confident</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_05">It is a sad day when friends must part, farewell.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_04">Carthage stood by your side, and will do again, if the gods will it. Until then, we look to our own defences!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_06">Some birds cannot be caged and so fly free, my friend.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_01">Such is the way of the world. Friends part. Lovers part. Only the Ba'al Hammon is constant, eternal and just.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_03">Do you cast all your friends aside so easily?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_cancel_cooperation_02">It is known men are as changeable as the seasons. Only Ba'al Hammon is constant.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_offer_demand_10">I do not hold with overlong talk, preferring the axe's edge as an argument. So listen, and then agree…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_current_treaty_vassal_of_player">This faction is a satrapy of yours ||They can't start a war, have allies of their own, and your enemies are shared. They also send you a sum of money in tribute each turn. Tribute you receive per turn: %n</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomacy_option_cancel_treaty_tooltip">Consider cancelling a treaty that is not in your best interest. However, there will be a diplomatic relations penalty for doing so. Also, doing so prematurely may be considered treachery.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_single_payment_01">Gold. Gold. Gold.The people of Carthage require gold.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_single_payment_02">Why bandy words when gold is involved? You have it, we like it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_single_payment_03">The people of Carthage place great value on freely given gifts of gold.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_request_cooperation_02">There is much worthiness in making and abiding by treaties, particularly with Pharaoh, the honour of Egypt.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_request_cooperation_03">A treaty is a worthy thing. A treaty with Pharaoh, the Lord of the Nile, is worthy twice over.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_request_cooperation_01">I offer you honourable treaties and aid against mutual enemies. So speaks my lord Pharaoh, the chief ornament of Egypt.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_request_cooperation_06">I would speak of treaties, as between equals. That is the import of my mission for divine Pharaoh.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_request_cooperation_04">I do not lightly speak of treaties and permanent agreements. I am the honest servant of divine Pharaoh in this matter.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_soft_access">Military Access</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_offer_request_cooperation_05">Pharaoh, highest of the high, would have a treaty with you. There, honesty is the best approach in these things!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_09">Divine Pharaoh will be pleased at your acceptance. Any step along the path of wisdom is a good one. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_reject_09">I fear that Sutekh has placed doubt and confusion in your hearts. Pharaoh, from whom mercy flows, will be saddened.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_08">Thoth has guided you from doubt to wise action. He is a kind god, in his way. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_reject_08">Glorious Pharaoh's humble servant does not understand your reluctance, but will carry word of it to Egypt's master.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_01">Thoth, in his wisdom, has come after much talk from us, and aided our deliberations. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_reject_01">Wisdom, then, is fled into the desert like a goat-stealing brigand if this is all we have after so many words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_03">For your agreement, the thanks of Pharaoh, the heir of Amun-Ra. Let your words weigh true in the balance!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_reject_03">I am saddened that wisdom is unknown among your people. Pharaoh, the guide of souls, will be equally sad.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_02">Unworthy servant to the mighty that I am, I thank you for your acceptance.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_reject_02">The Lord of Two Lands, the Father of Wisdom, will not understand your decision, but it is yours to make.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_05">Your acceptance is a welcome as a cool evening breeze after the desert's heat. My thanks.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_reject_05">I hope you are wise in this decision. Pharaoh, whose might encompasses the earth, will be disappointed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_04">You are wise beyond your years in this acceptance. Pharaoh, the fountain of beneficence, would have me thank you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_reject_04">Your decision is, I hope, not as foolish as it first appears. Perhaps Thoth will visit you later…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_07">To hear the words of Pharaoh, the Lord of the Two Niles, is a blessing. To accept them, wise indeed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_reject_07">You may reject the words of Pharaoh, master of the desert, in the morning, and hear them anew at evening.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_06">Your acceptance is most prudent and becoming to your wisdom. Pharaoh, divine master of Egypt, thanks you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_demanding_10">Be welcome, and may Hermes bless your words with appropriate speed, for I have other business today…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_state_gift_01">A gift, freely offered, and respectfully accepted, often does much to smooth the rocky road of diplomacy…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_state_gift_02">My people are eager to express their gratitude for a gift, given by you…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_state_gift_03">My people do not expect gifts. They like them, really like them, but they do not expect them. At all.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_angry_get_military_off_my_land_01">Our ancestors are restless! Please, get your soldiers off our lands or suffer the endless curses of our honoured dead!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_01">You jest, foreigner! We do not laugh, for the royal blood is too pure to bow to your filth!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_peace_01">Mars would turn his back on Rome if I heeded this foolish, weakling's proposal.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_angry_get_military_off_my_land_03">Your armies must leave our lands. The stench alone causes sows to miscarry, and all our sheep look nervous!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_03">Speak of this again and I will have you disembowelled and sent back to your people in canopic jars!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_peace_03">Stop Rome’s legions? I fear not. Our men must have their glory and plunder!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_angry_get_military_off_my_land_02">Your armies must go. One. Two. Three. Four... Five… Have your warriors left our lands yet? Six… Seven…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_02">Ah! So we are come to this. In Pharaoh's name, strength unto Him, I spit defiance in your insolent face!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_peace_02">Imperial anger is not yet spent. Peace does not interest the First Citizen of Rome or his Senators.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_peace_05">I am not surprised you want peace but, sadly for your people, the Senate has little mercy.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_trade_02">Trade with you? We do not believe in wasting the time of honest Roman merchants.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_attack_faction_01">This humble servant of Pharaoh, the river of joy to His people, dares to suggest an attack on these miscreants…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_peace_04">The Senate will not accept such a thing. Our soldiers hunger for glory and are not done feasting!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_trade_03">I am sure your goods are worthy, but Romans have no taste for them at this time. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_attack_faction_02">Pharaoh, the chief of heaven's strategists, asks that you attack these insolent people. They offend Him.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_beg_attack_faction_03">These people are surely as ripe grain by the river, waiting to be harvested! Can you carry out an attack?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_peace_06">There is a time for talk and for peace. Today is not the day.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_trade_01">Roman good taste does not demand the fripperies and geegaws that you offer in trade.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_client_state">Make Client State</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_accept_10">Your choices have been wise, and reflect well upon your people, even in comparison to Egyptians!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_reject_10">Our talk then has been like blossom on the desert breeze: beautiful, but soon dry and worthless.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_demanding_01">You have my attention. Speak and try to do it well, for diplomacy is always boring when done badly!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_demanding_02">I will listen. I cannot say for how long, for matters of state, and a splendid bowl of olives, demand attention.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_option_payment_on_table_tooltip_player_side">They will receive this payment if the deal gets accepted.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_demanding_03">We are not known as patient people. Therefore: welcome! Speak to the point.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_demanding_04">Welcome. The day is already old, and there is much to do, so if you have words, speak them. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_demanding_05">Greetings, in the name of Hermes. Speak but do not deceive with tricky rhetoric, false logic or cloying pathos!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_demanding_06">Greetings. Well, do not stand there, mute as though with the tongue cut from your head! Speak!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_demanding_07">I give you greeting, and my attention for the next few minutes. Make your case, but without a lawyer's tedium!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_demanding_08">Greetings. Do not waste time on ill-chosen words, although an hour or two bathing would have been useful…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_demanding_09">I will listen carefully to your words, and then give judgement. So, greetings, and now: business!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_hand_over_region_03">Please accept this gift of land from the people of Carthage.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_08">Your acceptance here will bring much satisfaction to my people. My thanks.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_reject_08">I spoke with honesty and this refusal is my payment. Such is the will of the gods…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_hand_over_region_02">We offer you our lands in the spirit of friendship.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_09">So it is done! You have shown great prudence in your choices today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_reject_09">Your decision does not please us but I hope your gods, at least, look upon it kindly.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_offer_hand_over_region_01">Carthage has deemed you worthy to rule these lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_01">Excellent news indeed. I shall feast, in modest fashion, on olives and good Greek wine.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_reject_01">This discord is far from pleasing but I will accept your reservations on this matter.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_02">We welcome your acceptance. Your wisdom echoes that of Athena herself!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_reject_02">I struggle to see wisdom in this decision and fear this could lead to misunderstandings and discontent. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_03">You serve the gods and your people well with this agreement. I will make sacrifice in thanks of it.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_reject_03">I am saddened that Athena has not given you wisdom to see the merits of our noble offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_04">Apollo smile on you for this acceptance. You are an ornament to your city… land… people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_reject_04">We trust you have thought long on this; this may eventually invite great sorrow for your people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_05">By the tetractys! You have a good mind in your skull. Your decision here is most excellent.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_reject_05">I wonder what malevolent spirits were whispering in your ear to make you think this was wisdom…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_06">Your people must think you an Aristotle! Your acceptance is most welcome. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_07">You have spoken with clarity of thought and a rhetorical flourish. You have surely earned the favour of your gods. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_reject_07">Are these words from a sober tongue? If so, then I must accept them even as I despair of them…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_state_gift_01">Pharaoh, son of the Gods, is mortal enough to enjoy gifts. Freely given gifts, of course…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_state_gift_03">While Pharaoh, mightiest of monarchs, can rightly claim the entire world as His own, gifts are always appropriate…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_state_gift_02">Any difficulties with Pharaoh, the great architect of Egypt, could be considerably eased with an appropriate gift…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_attack_faction_01">We would be forever in your debt if you ordered your worthy generals to act against these monsters!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_attack_faction_03">The enemy casts a shadow over us all. Will you send your soldiers, a most brave phalanx, to crush them?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_beg_attack_faction_02">Your generals might be the sons of Ares himself! We ask you today to send them against these wicked people…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_cooperation_05">We are much alike and so, by the flame, there is much sense to a treaty between us.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_cooperation_04">There is much merit in a treaty between us. So speak the wise at our temples…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_cooperation_06">A treaty would be an arrow, shot with deadly intent against our mutual enemies…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_cooperation_01">I propose a simple treaty, between equals and friends. All can profit by this offer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_cooperation_03">My lord and his chamberlains see much advantage in a treaty. What do you say?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_request_cooperation_02">A treaty between our peoples would see us all stronger and richer. Is there need of further embellishment?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_02">Among your own folk I am sure such idiocy passes for wit! But you are not among your own folk…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_03">Suggest this again, and you will eat your own manhood. Fried, in fat, from your own ample arse!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_01">This is a fine joke, and I laugh even as I spit my defiance in your face! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_single_payment_01">Ha! Away with your foolishness, before you feel a golden boot at your arse, emissary or no!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_single_payment_02">The spirits would not let me rest easily if I gave you money and, in the doing, took honour.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_single_payment_03">Where have you put your people's pride? Is it eaten by wolves, or pecked away by carrion birds? Gold? No.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_accept_10">Wisdom should always be admired, even in small things. Let us hope today's acceptance is a great thing!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_acknowledge_reject_10">This is not pleasing to gods or men. I had expected more from one considered wise.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_reject_angry_demand_client_status_01">What? Should I offer myself to the Theban Sacred Band to be used and cast aside? NO!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_demand_cooperation_06">It is our destiny to row in the same trireme, for a while at least. Recognise this, and know happiness.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_offer_demand_cooperation_05">We do not offer our trust easily or readily. Take this offer, and enjoy our favour. Refuse, and arouse suspicion…</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_accept_begging_01">Truly, my good and noble friend, your kind words and learned debate have smoothed the path to agreement.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_requesting_10">Greetings, my friend. You have my ear for your speech and, if it profits my people, agreement too.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_wealth_medium">Moderate</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_trade_03">Your merchants and their children will weep from hunger. Egyptians will not weep for lack of your wares.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_offer_or_demand_hostage">text_rejected</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_trade_02">So be it. Pharaoh, health and strength be His, has already issued orders to expel your merchants.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_acknowledge_cancel_trade_01">Very well. Your goods only cheated honest Egyptian purchasers anyway.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_requesting_01">I am here to listen, if you speak honestly. Truth will be your sharpest weapon.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_requesting_03">For the sake of friendship that has been and friendship to come, greetings. Now: let us seek wisdom together.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_requesting_02">Be welcome. But may Athena strike us all dumb if we speak anything but truth in our deliberations.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_get_military_off_my_land_01">My lord has ordered me to remove your soldiers from his land, and therefore I say they must go.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_requesting_05">Greetings. We are civilised folk, so you may speak as you wish and we will give you an honest answer.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_requesting_04">Be welcome here, and speak as you wish, without fear of consequence or danger.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_get_military_off_my_land_03">Your armies do little to calm the nerves of my master. He asks that they be removed.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_requesting_07">I am honoured to receive this embassy, and will listen with interest to all you have to say.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_get_military_off_my_land_02">We weary of being good hosts to your armies. Have them march away while we still have some wine!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_requesting_06">Welcome! I throw open the doors to you, and bid you enjoy our talks!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_requesting_09">Enter, friend, and speak. We surely have much to discuss, and perhaps much to agree!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_receive_requesting_08">Be welcome! If I can give you a fair answer, you will have it!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_begging_05">Honoured friend! I pray that you will hear my words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_defend_against_faction_offer_03">Rome’s legions are at your disposal if you require our strength.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_begging_04">I am here to offer terms that are both fair and just.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_defend_against_faction_offer_02">Do you need Roman help in this matter? You need only ask, and the Senate will order it done.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_begging_07">I am the voice of the people of Carthage and I bring you their words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_defend_against_faction_offer_01">We are willing to stand against these people, if you think such efforts will help your cause.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_begging_06">I am pleased to see you, my friend! May we sit and talk awhile?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_begging_01">The people of Carthage send their blessings and greetings and hope that you will hear their words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_begging_03">Greetings! I come to you as a humble friend hoping to share wise and honest words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_begging_02">The blessings of Ba'al Hammon be upon you. We have much to discuss.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_begging_09">Your honesty and virtue are well known in Carthage. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_begging_08">I would share words with you on matters of great import.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_trade_01">The marketplace will grow quiet, and many will weep at this ending, for wealth is dear to all.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_trade_02">If the river dries up, what will the fisherman eat? Will he still love his lord?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_acknowledge_cancel_trade_03">Our traders will look for new markets. They are adventuresome, and will enjoy the challenge!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_military_access_01">For many seasons your warriors have walked in our lands. Now the spirits are restless. Walk there no more.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_requesting_10">In the name of Pharaoh, Lord of Light and Darkness, I bid you be welcome, and to speak.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_get_military_off_my_land_02">Pharaoh, whose eye never sleeps, would have your warriors removed from his lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_get_military_off_my_land_03">My lord Pharaoh, the sword of Egypt, requests that you remove your armies from his lands. They disturb our tranquility.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_military_access_03">Your men are outlanders, and the spirits have become disturbed. Your armies must no longer march in our lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_cancel_military_access_02">Our lands are closed to you. March no more in our hunting grounds or fields. I have spoken. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_request_get_military_off_my_land_01">Mighty and all-seeing Pharaoh, blessed be He, has noticed that your warriors are in his lands. Remove them.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_approach_begging_10">I offer my words to your ears, and pray you find them to your liking.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_current_treaty_military_alliance">Military alliance ||Military allies are sworn to support each other if attacked or attacking another faction.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_not_interested_in_further_discussion_06">This meal of words has stuffed my belly. I will rise from the table, and seek other pleasures!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_not_interested_in_further_discussion_04">The Senate asks patience of its servants, but you have tried mine to breaking and beyond. Enough!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_not_interested_in_further_discussion_05">My mouth is as dry as a legionary sandal! We are done here. Let us cease talk and find wine!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_not_interested_in_further_discussion_02">My throat aches for good wine. Further talk is less to my taste.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_not_interested_in_further_discussion_03">I have sat and listened until my buttocks cry out for mercy! Rome demands much, but not such discomfort!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_not_interested_in_further_discussion_01">Patience is a Roman virtue, but the day has now grown too old for further talk.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_current_treaty_giving_soft_military_access_indefinite">Military access ||By having a military access pact you can trespass upon this faction's territory without diplomatic penalties.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_requesting_01">In Pharaoh's name, strength and wisdom be His, welcome, and speak remembering that all is within His divine hearing!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_requesting_02">Welcome, and the peace of Pharaoh, the favoured of Isis, be upon our meeting and in our words today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_requesting_03">Be welcome, friend of Egypt, and speak of your concerns to mighty Pharaoh's humble representative.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_requesting_04">I am the ears of divine Pharaoh, for he is not to be troubled by the concerns of ordinary mortals.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_requesting_05">Come, noble visitor, sit and ease your worries by speaking with the humble servant of Pharaoh, divine master of Egypt.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_requesting_06">Be at ease, good emissary. Speak your part as though Pharaoh, Lord of the Upper and Lower Nile, listened.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_requesting_07">Your embassy is most welcome. I listen most carefully as the servant of Pharaoh, Lord of the Two Houses.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_requesting_08">You undoubtedly have much to say, and I will listen for my master's part, a servant of dread Pharaoh.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_receive_requesting_09">Let the peace of Pharaoh, all-wise and all-seeing, be on our meeting today. And let us profit from talk!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_military_access_01">The Republic does not require, or want, foreigners-- and desperately in need of a bath, the lot of them-- tramping over Roman lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_military_access_03">Our lands will not be a road for your vagabonds. Have them walk another way, and downwind of good Romans!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_military_access_02">Any Senator would be more likely to bed the King of the Moon People than to agee your lunacy!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_get_military_off_my_land_03">Remove yourself and take your odious creatures with you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_get_military_off_my_land_02">There are but two choices for your armies. Leave or wither. Which do you choose?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_get_military_off_my_land_01">Nature divides the weak from the strong. Your sort was never meant for the lands of Carthage.</string>

<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_03">Very well, our men will leave. Let us pray to the Gods that they are not replaced by your enemies!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_02">We will order Roman armies to leave your lands; the peace should be maintained.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_acknowledge_get_military_off_my_land_01">The legions will leave. Perhaps when neighbours covet your lands you will welcome us again.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_wealth_very_high">Very Strong</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_war_declaration_02">We shall put aside words and draw the bow. The arrow will strike where it will, and widows will weep.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_war_declaration_03">By the flame, I will have my lord's torturers prepare special excruciations, O cowardly one! Until our next meeting!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_war_declaration_01">War it is then! I look forward to it! I relish it! I tingle at the thought of your cities aflame!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_war_08">The people of Carthage cry out for the blood of your people, and they shall have it!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_war_declaration_06">Look to your gods, and pray, for only in them will you now find mercy.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_war_09">The drums of war are beating, and now they beat for you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_war_declaration_07">So be it! In all our bellies the flame of war now burns pure and clear! </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_war_declaration_04">Honourable enemies we will be in war! I trust, my once-friend, your people will fall into darkness and despair!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_war_declaration_05">My unflinching master will burn your cities, your towns, your villages, your dungheaps, until the sky is dark with smoke!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_war_04">War it is, may the blood of your people fall like spring rains from the sky!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_war_05">We shall sweep across your lands like a vengeful plague. You have brought death to your people!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_war_06">I will offer sacrifice to Ba'al Hammon and he will destroy your people!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_war_declaration_08">Return to your people and prepare them for death. That is now your only duty.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_war_07">We will destroy you! Go.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_war_declaration_09">Now that words have failed, become an undertaker. That way, you may profit from this war!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_war_01">War then: how would you like the skulls of your warriors stacked when it is done?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_war_02">The funeral pyres will darken the sky. Such is the will of the gods. It is not for us to question.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_war_03">When you reach your homeland the grass will be dead, your wives will be howling, and the sky itself will have claws!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_begging_04">I will speak fair words in the name of Pharaoh, Lord of the Two Egypts, so that agreement comes quickly.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_begging_05">In the name of All-Wise Pharaoh, hail! Give gracious hearing to my mission.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_begging_06">I speak with the voice of Pharaoh, the Merciful and Just, and bid you hear my words with kindness.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_begging_07">May wisdom of Thoth be yours as you listen. So speaks my master, glorious Pharaoh!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_begging_01">I bring greetings to you, friend of Pharaoh, glory and wealth unto Him, and the blessings of His words.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_begging_02">Greetings and blessings from the mouth of Pharaoh, the blessed of Maat, at this joyous meeting of friends!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_begging_03">Blessings unto the worthy, given in the name of mighty Pharaoh, and greetings to our friends!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_06">I plead for peace, not from cowardice but from concern. If we fight on, only our rivals profit…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_trade_01">We seek trade and prosperity for all. I am sure that you can see that, in your noble wisdom…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_04">We have all asked much of our warriors. Now, I beg, let us give them rest.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_trade_03">I respectfully ask that you consider opening your markets to our traders, for that way profit flows to all.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_05">Our enemies watch with glee while we bleed in the uncaring dust. Shall we spite our foes, and have peace?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_trade_02">Your merchants are renowned as skilled and honourable traders. They would be made welcome in our markets!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_military_access_01">Our warriors will come and go as they please. Be wise, and stand aside at your border.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_begging_08">I would beg a little of your time to hear my unworthy embassy, although I speak but poorly.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_02">Do you have enough glory to be merciful? Can I ask for peace, and hope for its coming?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_defend_against_faction_01">These creatures have offended mighty Carthage; they must be stopped!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_regular_payment_01">For those wise enough to see, there is profit in being generous, and more profit in remaining generous…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_approach_begging_09">I have come with words from Pharaoh, the ornament of His people, to fill your ears with truth.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_03">My lord accepts that you are a worthy foe, but the time has come to set aside swords.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_military_access_03">Our warriors have no quarrel with you, and honour your courage, but they must march where they will…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_defend_against_faction_02">The people of Carthage come to you seeking assistance: will you help us?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_regular_payment_02">A regular tribute of gold to my lord helps his patience. I trust you see a necessity here…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_demand_military_access_02">Our warriors will pass through your lands. Be wise, and leave the door ajar…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_defend_against_faction_03">We must look to our defences. Can you assist us?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_demand_regular_payment_03">Our own riches are not so grand that they could never be improved by tribute from your people.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_01">Let there be peace, I beg. Surely now there has been enough bloodshed and misery?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_03">Save your gold. Sooner or later you will need a lavish funeral. I am told wailing mourners are expensive.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_02">I am genuinely startled! I did not think your people could count up to such big numbers!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_01">You think to buy us like catamites, like your whores? You think pride and honour are for sale! Bah!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_regular_payment_01">Such wealth as you possess you need, to buy, most urgently, the necessaries of culture and civilization.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_regular_payment_03">A worthy gesture, but one that is declined. The Senate will only wonder what lies behind such a gift.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_regular_payment_02">Senators, like all great men, enjoy wealth, but they do not want your wealth.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_player_must_become_client_02">The time has come for faltering hands to set aside the reins of government. Let us be your new masters…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_player_must_become_client_03">We offer our stewardship reluctantly. You have pride, but even the proud need others in times of danger.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_greek_request_player_must_become_client_01">Come now, accept the mastery of a truly civilized people. You will only benefit from our rule, you know. </string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_diplomatic_factor_war">War with</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_military_access_01">Our gods taught us some wisdom.  Armies can quickly turn to conquerors once they are inside the gates.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_military_access_03">The wise man closes his hall doors in winter, and keeps out the fierce winds that blow.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_military_access_02">No. The ancestors would sleep poorly if your men were tramping across our lands.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_join_confederation_02">Such grovelling would bring the fury of the gods upon us. And we would deserve their anger. As do you.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_regular_payment_03">The people of Carthage need to be convinced of your unflinching loyalty. Gold might help.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_too_many_counters_02">Enough! Enough! My ears ache from your hideous babble, and my guts roil from your foreign reek! Away with you!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_join_confederation_03">Only a goat eats everything within reach! You were birthed by a goat! You smell like one as well!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_regular_payment_02">A little gold, passing from one hand to another on a regular basis, forms a strong bond between those hands…</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_too_many_counters_03">In the name of Pharaoh, the Lord of Patience, enough, enough! Trouble my ears no longer!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_state_gift_01">You would be better regarded in Rome if you gave a gift to demonstrate your worth.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_request_regular_payment_01">I find that the people of Carthage are open to many new ideas when their coffers are full.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_war_declaration_10">Carrion birds and jackals will grow fat on your carcasses, and lose the taste for your rancid flesh!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_state_gift_02">Your people have wealth and goods in abundance, enought for a gift. Will you not look to it?</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_join_confederation_01">I will not hand over our people to your keeping. I would die of shame, and wander behind the winds, unlamented and cursed!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_too_many_counters_01">Your silly babble would send even a hippopotamus to sleep with its dull droning! For now: save your words!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_rome_request_state_gift_03">There are arrangements to be made between us. Perhaps a gift fitting Roman dignity would sway our words today.</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_too_many_counters_06">Your thoughts dash from river to desert like a maddened jackal! Speak no more, for we are done!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_too_many_counters_04">O gentle crocodiles, come end my suffering with your kindly jaws and teeth! I can listen no more!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_egypt_too_many_counters_05">Are we done? As a servant of mighty Pharaoh, my protector and master, I have better things to do!</string>
<string name="diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_carthage_acknowledge_war_10">Ba'al Hammon will become drunk on the blood of your people!</string>
